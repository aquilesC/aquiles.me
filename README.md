# Aquiles Carattino's Digital Garden

Welcome to the repository for my digital garden, published at [notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me).

## What is this?

This is a collection of my thoughts, notes, and ideas explicitly linked together to form a graph of knowledge. It is built around the concepts of the Zettelkasten method and evergreen notes. Unlike a traditional blog, there is no strict structure, chronological order, or expectation of polished articles—just a free flow of thoughts interconnected by backlinks. 

Through the relationship between notes taken far apart in time, mood, and epistemic status, I try to build new insights. This digital garden is a forever-growing *work in progress*, gardened in public.

## About Me

My name is Aquiles Carattino. I am a physicist, entrepreneur, and business developer. I'm passionate about microscopy, optics, nanoparticles, programming, and tackling challenges like climate change, open source, privacy, and digital education.

## Entry Points

Since a digital garden lacks a traditional index, the best way to navigate is by following a train of thought. If you're not sure where to start, here are the best entry points to understand what I do and what this space is about:

- [**About Me**](https://notes.aquiles.me/about_me) - A brief introduction about who I am, my professional journey, and my hobbies.
- [**About this Website**](https://notes.aquiles.me/%C2%A7about) - Context on why this space exists, why it's not a blog, and how it was born.
- [**Digital Garden**](https://notes.aquiles.me/digital_garden/) - My thoughts on what a digital garden is and the process of tendering one.
