Separating scientific disciplines such as *physics*. *biology*, etc. is contradictory to the world we live in. The scientific method should be taught transversally to different disciplines and questions should be answered with a full body of knowledge, not with partial interests (for example, conservation of energy in physics separated from conservation of energy in biology, etc.)
