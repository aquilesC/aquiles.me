Bullet journaling is, before all, a method to offload tasks from our mind. Instead of forcing ourselves to remember that we must make a phone call or send an e-mail, we can simply write it down. This could have some scientific basis: see the [[Zeigarnik effect]]. 

My open questions are:

- Is writing by hand more efficient than writing on a computer?
- What techniques can be used to achieve [[low friction working]]?
