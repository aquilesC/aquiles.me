# 2020 Bikepacking trip through Belgium

The 12 of August 2020 we started a [[bikepacking]] trip through Belgium. We had **one reason**: Taking some days off, maintaining a [[Covid19]]-safe approach. The only **real goal** was to arrive to [[La Roche en Ardennes]] by the 14 of August, since we had a standing reservation. We had no specific destinations, nor time constraints. We did an 18-day trip:

- Day 1: Sittard to Maastricht
- Day 2: Maastricht to Esneux
- Day 3: Esneux to La Roche en Ardennes
- Day 4: Hiking in Ardennes
- Day 5: La Roche en Ardennes to Rochefort
- Day 6: Rochefort to Dinant
- Day 7: Around Dinant
- Day 8: Dinant to Chimay
- Day 9: Chimay to Mons
- Day 10: Mons to Saint Denijs
- Day 11: Saint Denijs to Ypres
- Day 12: Ypres to Koksijde-Bad
- Day 13: Koksijde-Bad to Sluis
- Day 14: Resting in Sluis
