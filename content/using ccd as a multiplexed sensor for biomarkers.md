In the same way that Hard Drive technology can be used to build a multiplexed sensor for biomarkers ([[literature/202204260848 Using GMR for protein kinetics detection]]), perhaps it is also possible to leverage existing electronics technology to think about other multiplexing strategies. 

One possibility would be to build a sensor on a CCD (or CMOS) chip. At pixel sizes of around 1$$\mu m$$ to 4$$\mu m$$ and millions of them individually addressable, there could be a clear path for on-sensor detectors.
