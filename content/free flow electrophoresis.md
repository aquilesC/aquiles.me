In Free Flow Electrophoresis (see also: [[literature/202301192057 Free Flow Electrophoresis]]), an electric field is applied perpendicular to a hydrodynamically pumped liquid system which consists of a sample fed into a carrier electrolyte. Particles are deflected in the flow depending on the drag velocity and the [[electrophoretic mobility]]. This leads to a bidimentional separation with subsequent fractionation at the outlets.
