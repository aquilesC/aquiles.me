The role of primary education is paramount in the development of children that would later become active participants in the political and social lives of their communities. 

Primary education is crucial in shaping the future of educative success of students, and is therefore the best moment to start developing scientific thinking in youngsters. 

There is evidence that kids can form theories about the world that surrounds them[@furman2020]. The way they explore the world is very similar to "professional" [[scientific Exploration and Play]]. 

It must be strengthen the access to approaches that enhance the access of kids to scientific practices (see: [[science education should be method-oriented]]). There is only so much that students can develop by themselves, and they'll need support to push their boundaries further. However, the approach should not be content-based (see: [[education is content based]]), but should be based on experimentation and interpretation (see: [[Curiosity-driven education]])[@furman2020].
