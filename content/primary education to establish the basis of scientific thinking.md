The role of primary education is paramount in the development of children that would later become active participants in the political and social lives of their communities. 

Primary education is crucial in shaping the future of educative success of students, and is therefore the best moment to start developing scientific thinking. 

There is evidence that kids can form theories about the world that surrounds them[@furman2020]. The way they explore the world is very similar to "professional" [[scientific Exploration and Play]]. 

However without deliberate practices, the kids will not fully develop complete scientific thinking. There is only so much that students can develop by themselves, and they'll need support to push their boundaries further. The role of teachers and how they make students achieve [[basic competences that define scientific literacy]] must be strengthen. 

The method that is gaining traction is [[curiosity-driven education]], and there are more critics to the idea of [[education is content based]]. Although, many ideas overlap with the principle that [[science education should be method-oriented]][@furman2020], there still problems. For example [[Teaching curricula in latin america fail to guide teachers]], rendering the access to improving cycles almost negligible. 

What is important to discuss as well is that [[ideas are born through interaction with the world]], and therefore there should be methods for kids to use their scientifically derived skills outside of the walls of schools.
