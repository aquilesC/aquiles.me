Measuring the concentration of [[extracellular vesicles]] is challenging because they are small (hence, diffuse to fast) and they are very dim. 

A way to overcome these limitations is to embed the particles in a hydrogel after fluorescently labelling them. This is the approach followed on the [[EVQuant]] protocol. 

To measure the concentration, a [[light sheet]] microscope is used. We started off by using an [[OpenSPIM]] design, which was partially adapted to the needs of [[Dispertech]], for example using a linear stage instead of a 4D stage, since one of the assumptions is that the sample is isotropically distributed. 

One of the **main limitations** of the approach is that particles must be fluorescently labelled, and there is no way of discriminating false-positives. A large effort must be placed
