Although the double blind assessment of people, i.e. that both the person applying and the person judging don't know who the other is, seems like a good idea, it does not necessarily point to a solution of the problem of people not playing in a level field[^1]. 

Although the story of musicians in the New York Philarmonic are a paradigmatic example of how the double blind (performers were behind a curtain) helped women get into the orchestra bypassing the bias of the judges, the same is hard to see elsewhere, such as in tech (see: [[gender diversity in tech]]), or academia (see: [[gender diversity in academia]]). 

The core of the problem is the metric used to judge, if the metric favors men, then the double blind will only exacerbate the problem, since it will make it *more valid*. If women are given tasks of lower scientific value through their careers (such as teaching or taking care of other things in the lab), at the moment of judging who deserves a promotion they'll be at a loss. Without even considering [[how much unpaid work is done by women]].
