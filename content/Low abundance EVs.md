In the context where every cell (and even organelles) can create [[extracellular vesicles]] that are then released to the environment, detecting very low abundance species can be the only way to use them as diagnostic markers (see [[Extracellular vesicles as markers for prostate cancer]], [[EVs can be used as ovarian cancer markers]] [[using EVs as biomarkers]])

Some strategies focus on enrichment of specific subpopulations based on physicochemical traits (for example see: [[Size exclusion chromatography is the second most popular EV enrichment method]] and [[Ultra centrifugations is the most popular EV enrichment method]]). 

Besides enrichment, readout systems that have high-throughput and the ability to detect single-events can be a valuable tool to [[use EVs as biomarkers]]. See, for example: [[literature/202301141333 Comparing SiMoA and SP-IRIS]].
