# Github Actions

- Check how actions work and think about things that can be done with them #TODO . For example:
- [Running tests](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2020/github-actions-first-impressions/) for Experimentor
- Schedule Twitter posts/threads
- Periodically pull data from an API and do something with it?
