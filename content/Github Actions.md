# Github Actions

[[TODO]] Check how they work and think about things that can be done with them. For example:
- [Running tests](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2020/github-actions-first-impressions/) for Experimentor
- Schedule Twitter posts/threads
- Periodically pull data from an API and do something with it?
