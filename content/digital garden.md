In its most fundamental definition, a **digital garden** is a collection of notes taken on an electronic medium. 

Gardening became very entangled with the [[Zettelkasten method]], which was popularized, perhaps, with the book [[essays/Notes on How to Take Smart Notes|How to Take Smart Notes]]. Although [[Luhmann method]] was born around a static medium such as paper, today we have available other support media, that lead to [[evergreen notes]], i.e. infinitely editable, improvable, and linkable notes. 

Editing notes, finding new links and checking the merging structure became known as [[Tendering a digital garden]]. Perhaps it's from here that the nickname evolved. See also: [[leveraging the digital medium for better note taking]]. 

Following the guidelines of the [[Zettelkasten method]], it is worth making it clear that [[Gardening is not just collecting]], but actively finding links between different pieces of knowledge.

## Gardens for Inspiration
Some gardens that acted as inspiration while building this website. It is worth mentioning that over time, I simply stopped checking them.
