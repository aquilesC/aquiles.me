They are proposed by Alexander Osterwalder (from the [[Business Model Canvas]]), but I am not completely sure how they would work besides the paper version of a model without execution. 

The idea is to force people into [[Design thinking for business models]], meaning that they put their minds in a free mode, in order to explore even absurd ideas before tossing them out. It can start with a short pitch: outline idea, value proposition, revenue streams. 

Then it can grow to a full canvas, estimate market potential, fact-check, etc. 

Finally, a **field test** with real customers can be done. Things like value proposition validation, and market acceptance can be measured.
