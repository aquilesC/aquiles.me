In [[The Future we Choose - Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac]], the authors argue that if we don't change the amount of greenhouse gases we emit, and therefore do not limit the heating of the world to well under 2 degrees, the future will look very gloom. 

Heating in some places of the world mean that people can't spend unlimited time outside anymore. Above a certain threshold, it is not possible for humans to survive more than few hours. Heating changes rain patterns, which in turn turns soil that was apt to agriculture completely inert. 

Water will be harder to get, since glaciers will not be able to regulate the flow of fresh water through the year. This will generate conflicts within nations, and within countries themselves. Access to water will be crucial. Desalination will not be able to keep up for every need. 

This pressure both on water and on food will have immediate impacts on health, and in turn on inequality. Rich countries, and rich people in poorer countries, will be able to secure what they need. On the other hand, the rest will not be able to cover basic needs. 

Fishes will be depleted and food security on coastal areas is highly threatened. International support is pointless, since every one will try to save themselves. The European Union will collapse. New diseases will start popping out due to emergence of pathogens from under the permafrost. Change in insects, animals, and human distribution patterns around the glob will spread sickness like never before. 

The author of the book stress more than once that inequality will be enhanced to never before seen levels. Mass migrations are going to be impossible to handle by the world, leading to violence, militarization, and death.
