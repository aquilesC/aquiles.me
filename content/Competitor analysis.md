The [[competitive landscape]] is a crucial element that new ventures must carefully evaluate before jumping at a market. However, most [[scipreneurs]] focus on the [[categories of competitors]] as a way of identifying *threats* rather than opportunities. 

Competitors in a space are defined by customers, not by the technology or by other companies. What matters is how users solve their problems, that's how you can build a competitive landscape. 

Sometimes you can be completely blindsided when you focus on similar technologies. Suddenly you realize a very low tech approach solves the same problem in a way you could not anticipate. 

On the other hand, you may be to narrowly focused on a company that claims to solve a problem, but if your customers don't know it, or don't use it in that way, then you still have an open landscape. 

The [[Blue Ocean strategy]] should be a way of identifying a niche within a market (see: [[Ten metrics to judge a market]]) but [[Blue Ocean strategy gives little insight]]. 

[[jobs theory]], and specifically [[jobs theory and customer journeys]] can be a great tool to identify not just opportunities, but how users perceive the alternatives. After all, [[there is always a solution to the problem]].
