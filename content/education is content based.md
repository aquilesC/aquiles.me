Most educational programs focus on the content that must be transmitted to students. For example, by establishing the minimum number of math topics that a student should master after completing each year. 

Many people keep discussing about *content*, for example [[replacing analysis with statistics]] in math classes, but few discuss [[why we teach science in school]]. Efforts, such as Khan Academy, focus on delivering *content* to students, but not on how to improve the method of teaching. 

Establishing minimum content sounds like a quantifiable way of judging performance (see: [[measuring performance using single criteria]]), but my open question is whether [[science education should be method-oriented]] instead of content-based.
