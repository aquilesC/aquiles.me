# Things I've Done
It is hard to summarize the things I've done, especially because some are relatively small, but not less important in my life. 

## Some things I am doing right [[now]]:
- [[Dispertech]]
    - Everything from [[business development]], to [[optics design]], including [[instrumentation software]], and [[prototype development]].
- [[Python for the Lab]]
- [Klimaat Helpdesk](https://www.klimaathelpdesk.org/)
- [[This website is not a blog|This Website]]

## Things I've done (some I may re-start):
This list of things belong, somewhat, to my past, but they also have an impact on my present. Some were stepping stones, some were really path changers. I am still evaluating which is which.
