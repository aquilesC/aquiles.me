epistemic: I have been researching the topic of technology transfer and science-based venture building for several years. It is the moment to share back.

**The idea**: If I could send advice once per week to the myself of 5 years ago, what would it be. 

**The goal**: After 3 months of *shallow thinking* (i.e. with little time-commitment), they should be able to decide by themselves if it's a path worth pursuing and what would it take. 

**The format**: Build it as weekly e-mails to be sent on a Monday, so people have one week to work on the topics. Each message should have some context and some 'to-do'

**The unique value proposition**: No-BS. From someone who is walking the walk. Content tailored to scientists, mostly PhD's and Postdocs, smart people who have a specific world view. 

## Month 1
### Week 1: Entrepreneurial Readiness
- **Why** to become an entrepreneur
- What it takes to be an entrepreneur: Personal traits, and challenges of starting a venture. 
- Self-assessment questionnaire: Personality, Resources, Network, Risk tolerance
    - **Important**: There is no right/wrong. If you know yourself, you will also know with whom to partner up. Two risk-intolerant people or two over-risk-takers are not the best match. 
### Week 2: Crafting the value proposition
- Talk to people early on. -> Open ended questions. 
- What do you want to do? 
    - Don't focus on price (!)
- Who are you helping?
- What problem do you think you are solving? ([[Love the problem if you don't know what it is?]])
### Week 3: Who can be an entrepreneur
- Effectuation theory (Suggested readings)
- What resources do you have available *now*?
    - Money
    - Network <- Did you talk to the people last week?
    - Tools
    - Time <- You are already reading this e-mail!
- What resources do you think you need? 
    - Lab space
    - Money
    - People
### Week 4: Competitive Landscape Analysis
- SWOT (?)
    - Comparing to other solutions
    - But from the *potential customer* perspective!
- Iterating on the value proposition
