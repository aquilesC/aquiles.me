# Why not all my e-mails are signed
When I discovered how easy it is to digitally signed [[my e-mail]], I started generating PGP keys for each address I have. This, however, became a problem when I realized Windows does not encrypt the hard drive. I won't gamble the possibility of having my keys stolen, and password protecting them made it harder to work through e-mail. This is especially true when on the phone trying to answer e-mails. 

**I had to compromise**. I sign my e-mails when I send them from my Linux machine, and I added a signature warning people when I send a message from my phone (just a pretext for brevity and typos). This is, however, only valid for the messages I send from my general accounts. Through my ProtonMail account, on the other hand, I always send PGP-Signed (and encrypted if possible) messages.
