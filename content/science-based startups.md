Sometimes referred as [[deep tech]], or [[hard tech]] (not sure about the definitions, though), I tend to see the definition as those companies that are rooted in basic science principles, and that operate on the development of new scientific results. 

[[Instrumentation]] companies (those that build tools to perform measurements) are a clear example. They build tools **for** scientists. 

A marketing company **for** science-based startups, however, is not scientifically-based in itself. 

And I think it is important to have a special distinction for science-based companies, because there is an inherent cost (sometimes hidden) to performing *research* in a startup.

The confusion zone between business and technologies generates the **need** for research (founders keep doing what they were doing), pushing commercialization down to the future. The risk is that the amount of resources needed keep growing, which in turn means more investment is needed, diluting the founders shares or putting a temporary halt to a promising technology.
