## Warming Up
Start the session by worming up focusing on a problem which is not related to the problem at hand. In order to encourage people to surpass inhibitions, a possible exercise is "The Silly Cow": come up with a [[business model]] that includes a cow. They produce milk, eat grass, and make mooing sounds. 

The idea is for people to see they are able to come up with innovative ideas even if in a context radically different from what they do on a daily basis. Moreover, if there are more senior (or power dynamics) in the team, it can help having them onboard showing there is nothing to be embarrassed about. 
## Brainstorming Rules 
- Stay focused
	- Define the problem early on. Never let the discussion wander too far from the true purpose of the brainstorming session
- Enforce rules (Facilitators should enforce them)
	- "Defer judgement": There will be a time to prioritize ideas
	- "One conversation at a time": Avoid split focus in the group
	- "Go for quantity": Don't censor yourself based on preconceptions
	- "Be visual": Sometimes a drawing or schematic and be more useful than words
	- "Encourage wild ideas": 
- Think Visually
	- Sketch ideas in a way everyone can see
	- Using PostIt notes helps to move ideas around and see how they connect
- Prepare
	- Prepare the participants with an immersion experience related to the problem at hand. Either by talking to customers, doing a field trip, etc.
