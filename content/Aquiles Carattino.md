I am a physicist who became an entrepreneur. I have a [[my phd|PhD]] in optics, focusing on the characterization of [[gold nanoparticles]]. I studied ways of using them as temperature sensors in very small scales, as well as how to employ them as labelling agents for cell biology. 

I founded [[Dispertech]] back in 2019 together with [[Sanli Faez]], [[Hans Brouwer]], and [[Steven Tan]]. We have heavily focussed on the characterization of [[extracellular vesicles|extracellular vesicles]], which can be regarded as a form of naturally occurring nanoparticles. 

I have a broad range of interests, including [[open hardware]] and [[impact investment]]. I dance [[tango]] in my free time, and go sailing when the weather allows it. I worry about [[user privacy online]], and like complaining on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/aquicarattino).

I spend some time programming, mostly with Python. There's an incomplete list of [[things I've done]] up to [[now]].
