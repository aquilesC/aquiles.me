[[Extracelluar vesicle]]s can be used as markers for [[prostate cancer]]. The general idea is that patients with cancer will have a higher abundance of exosomes with [[CD9]] and [[CD63]], therefore if it would be possible to quantify the amount of these proteins, they would become a clear path to diagnosis. 

One possible path is to combine [[TR-FIA]] with europium labeling[@duijvesz2015a]. An essay similar to [[Elisa tests]] with fluorescence is able to quantify the amount of [[CD9]] and [[CD63]] in urine samples from patients with and without prostate cancer.

The overall idea is that quantifying the concentration of [[CD9]] and [[CD63]], it is possible to have a better diagnostic tool than by just looking at [[PSA]] levels.
