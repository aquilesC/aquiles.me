When working at low concentrations (see: [[why pushing sensitivity of assays]], [[Simoa]], [[literature/202212291648 Optical methods for single molecule analysis]]), there is a fundamental limit known as [[Poisson Sampling]]. In essence, a rule of thumb to have a statistical significant result is to measure at least 10000 molecules[@walt2013]. Using that the error is approximately $\sqrt{n}$, with 10000 molecules one gets an error of 100 (1%).
