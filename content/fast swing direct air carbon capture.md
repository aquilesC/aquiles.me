This [[carbon capture]] the technology is developed at [[Carbyon]] (see: [[companies working on carbon capture]]). It is based on using a composite fiber of potassium carbonate, that enhances the total surface are through which air flows and leads to higher chances of getting a $CO_2$ molecule adsorbed to the surface. 

$$
CO_2 + H_2O + K_2CO_3 \leftrightarrows 2KHCO_3
$$
The equation is reversible because under heat, the [[carbon dioxide]] will desorb from the fibers and can be captured. 

One of the challenges is that water competes for binding sites, which means that in high humidity places, the capture efficiency can be altered. 

An interesting aspect of the technology is that carbon will desorb at around $60^oC$ which means the energy requirements can be lower. 

The target energy consumption of [[Carbyon]] is set at $1500kWh/CO_{2ton}$ (a quick math yields around $0.4_{emission}/1_{capture}$).

According to "our world in data", emissions for energy generation is $268g/kWh$ in the Netherlands, and $481g/kWh$ average in the world. I wonder if this equation is enough to validate the energy efficiency of the system and how it would compare to others. 

The secret is to use very low emission energy sources (for instance, by switching on/off when there's excess wind available).
