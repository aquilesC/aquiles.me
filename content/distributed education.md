One of the challenges of standard education systems is that they require students to have access to a school and consequently to a teacher. In many contexts, the access to specific schools has a correlation with education output[@furman2020], which generates a bias towards urban kids of rich neighborhoods. 

If education could be distributed, this means that access to a central location is no longer required, students could have a more level field. [[Digital distribution of educational content]] is one possible path (such as Khan Academy) but it is built on the premise of kids working alone. 

Another possible path could be through partial [[gamification of education]], forcing kids to interact and build together. This could be achieved with [[RPG for teachinig]], but potentially with many different strategies. 

The idea of distributed learning is to use the tools at hand to learn, even if access to a central location is not accessible. For example, kids could learn from other kids, or an adult could follow some standard *recipes* to guide students towards understanding.
