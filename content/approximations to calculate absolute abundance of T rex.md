To calculate the abundance and preservation rate of T Rex through time, there are several approximations that must be drawn. The biggest source of uncertainty is the application of [[Damuth Law]], because it depends on parameters about the animals that may not be completely known. For example, carnivores and herbivores would yield different parameters. 

The metabolism also plays a role, in which case assuming that T. Rex was closer to a Komodo dragon than to a mammal or a reptile could make sense[@marshall2021]. The other question is the body mass, that must be extrapolated by a growth curve. 

From these approximations, it is possible to *conclude* that the population density of T. Rex was between 0.00058 and 0.14 individuals/km^2.
