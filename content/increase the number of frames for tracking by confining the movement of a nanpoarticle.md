Instead of performing [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] in free diffusion, one can confine the movement to a smaller geometry such as a 1D channel in order to improve the accuracy of the detection by increasing the total number of acquired frames, and the localization accuracy by lowering the background (@Faez2015).
