# Frugal Science
I have joined the Standford course on bio engineering lead by [[Manu Prakash]]. It is an incredibly interesting approach, with 50% local students, even though the platform is remote-first, using discord and [notion](https://www.notion.so/Syllabus-5f2fbe248e974fd4ba424c8378e142cd#f3d670708ac5446fb182d57bca7cea44) to manage the roadmap. 

Some key interesting things to keep in mind:

- Some people has empathy for the project they represent. They may not be the technical person, but they are the ones who are involved also emotionally
- The mentors that introduced themselves are from various backgrounds, not all directly involved with frugal science, but many with interesting backgrounds. Particularly: [[Shah Selbe]] and [[Sheri Bastien]]
