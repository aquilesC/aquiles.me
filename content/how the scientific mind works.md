![How the scientific mind works](/images/framework_content_centric_model.png)

Most people describe the scientific method as a play between hypothesis and validation. However, this neglects the emotional dimensions of the human mind at play, such as those involved in creativity and filtering[@ghanadan2016]. Therefore, from a marketing perspective, we can address the different aspects of the path with different types of content. 

The creative stage is when a scientists first engages with an idea, *recognize* they have a need, or sees an opportunity. This does not mean they have in their minds a *product need*. However, once the idea settles, they will *explore* different paths to make a hypothesis.

It is at this stage, once they have the hypothesis, that scientists evaluate the range of products available. This allows them to know how to validate/invalidate their hypothesis, which will finally become *evaluation* of tools that would allow them to reach their goals.
