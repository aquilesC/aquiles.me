The process for extracting [[EV]]'s from [[blood plasma]] is not straightforward. However, the core principle relies on [[size exclusion chromatography]]:  blood plasma is centrifuged twice to remove [[platelets]], and stored at -80. When needed, it is divided through a SEC column (technical term: [[eluted]], resulting samples are [[eluates]]).[^1].
