It drives how you execute your [[marketing]] strategy and spend. (This sounds very related to the [[Blue Ocean strategy]])

- Bring a new product to an [[Existing market marketing|Existing market]].
	- You'll be the weakest player with the least resources
	- Customers need performance
	- For a product it means better/faster. 
	- **Risks**: Can you compete with existing solutions? 
- Reframe an [[resegmented existing market positioning|existing market]]
	- Re-segment the market as a low-cost entrant
		-  Product needs to be *good enough* (for low cost) or specialized features.
	- Re-segment the market by serving a niche market
	- Customer needs *lower cost*, or a new perceived problem/need. (The focus is the [[Value proposition]]) 
	- Cloning a business model that has worked in another country (Mercado Libre, Bol.com, etc.)
	- **Risks**: low [[value proposition-market fit]], competition. 
- Bring a new product into a [[new market positioning|new market]]
	- This is what happens when you allow customers to do something they couldn't do before. Getting feedback and creating demand is much more challenging. 
	- The key isn't competing, but understanding if the customer base is large enough. 
	- Requires long-term customer education and adoption
	- Customers search for simplicity/convenience. 
	- The product can be low in traditional aspects, but they are improved by new customer metrics
	- **Risks**: market adoption -> [[Crossing the Chasm]] 

The decision influences many aspects: 
- Type of customer
- Market size
- Launch type
- Competitive barriers
- Positioning
