# Pareto Principle as a Mental Model
The [[Pareto Principle]] as a [[mental model]] says that we can shape our way of thinking in order to maximize the impact of our actions. If we are in a situation were (following the 80/20 rule) a couple of things generate us a big discomfort, while the majority of things do not have such a negative impact, we should identify those two things and remediate the issues. 

Of course, this extrapolation is assuming that there is a very big imbalance between the amount of things that happens and the impact they have on our lives.
