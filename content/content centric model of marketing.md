Modeling on top of [[how the scientific mind works]], it is possible to think about how to structure content so that it fits into the different stages of the scientific method. 

- **Leadership content** is the type of content that positions a company as an innovator. This is the type of content that would trigger the *recognition* of a scientist needs. 
- **Education Content** is requires when the scientist is in the *exploration* phase. By presenting balanced evidence it is possible to persuade a scientist to formulate a hypothesis around a given technology. (See: [[Education content for sales]]). 
- **Persuassion Content** is meant to provide evidence of the value proposition. Is the technology going to address the problems the scientist recognized. This is the *validation* of the commercially available solution.

The three types of content can be correlated to [[The Golden Circle]] very easily. The **why** is the stage to activate curiosity by asserting a provocative point of view. The **how** is provided by the educational content. Finally the **what** is the validation of the hypothesis. 

What I wonder is how to handle the fact that different companies can be operating on the same space. At [[Dispertech]] we do nanoparticle characterization, but we are no the only ones. Currently, since part of our technology is based on [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]], we try to leverage the existing educational content to lure people into talking to us. 

I have seen advertisements on search results with very aggressive wording against known techniques. Is this a valid way of shifting attention and perhaps trigger new ideas on a scientist?
