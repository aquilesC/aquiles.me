Humans are able to build knowledge that is passed through generations. This could be a feature unique to humans. At what point this distinctive pattern emerged, however, is not clear. 

> Human cultures, including our technologies, artifacts and traits, have progressed over time, becoming more sophisticated, complex and efficient as generations pass. This cumulative process, often described as the “ratchet effect”, specifically encapsulates how high-fidelity social learning maintains our cultural accomplishments until such a time as new, bene- ficial modifications are invented, which in turn are propagated via high fidelity social learning
