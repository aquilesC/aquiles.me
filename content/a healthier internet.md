# A Healthier Internet
To define healthier means to acknowledge that [[the internet is sick]]. Healthier therefore would mean:

* User data protection at all costs
* Individual protection above content protection (i.e. prevent hate speech, bullying, abuses)
* Avoid biases (surfacing more often content on specific topics to specific groups)
* Protect free speech
* Avoid dictatorial conduction on platforms of public interest
