Ensuring economic growth may be one of the tantamount directions of states. And since [[innovation leads to growth]], it is reasonable that policies are focussed on enabling innovation. 

It may be part of the reason why [[correlating GDP to scientific productivity is a reasonable proxy for progress]]. What I wonder is whether scientific productivity is a byproduct of innovation-focused states or if it drives it. 

One of the policies that states can establish to speed up innovation is to create [[knowledge networks]]. This is the case of why Japan was so successful after WWII even if it was spending a significantly lower percentage of GDP than the Soviet Union. (see: [[202311281015 Innovation led policies]]).
