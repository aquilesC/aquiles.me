In a similar line to the one outlined in ""[[The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it]]", the idea is that you should never confront someone by saying "You're wrong"[@carnegie2010]. The examples focus on sales dialogues, where someone may claim that another product is better. Instead of saying "That's not true, ours is better", we can patiently listen to what the other person has to say, dig on it, and then proceed with our pitch. 

This is also the case when someone is complaining about our product. Instead of saying "you are wrong and we are the best", by starting with a "we make many mistakes, so tell me what happen to you" disarms the other person and can help you win a heart. 

Another issue would be when you state that someone is wrong in public. The example is during a trial, an attorney says the judge is wrong. Big, big mistake. 

The interesting aspect of this chapter, compared to the previous one is that the author actually shows a way to educate the other person, without a passive-aggressive attitude. It is a matter of forms, not of content. First listen, then build upon.
