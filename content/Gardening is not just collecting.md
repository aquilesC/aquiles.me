A [[digital garden]] is not a place for randomly collecting pieces of information (like a bookmark system). The entire purpose is [[Tendering a digital garden]] as a way of [[actively creating knowledge]]. 

One of the advantages of the digital medium is that it allows to have [[evergreen notes]], that can change and evolve as time passes and new insight is gained. This is an extension to [[Luhmann method]], in which [[Luhmann notes are static|notes are static]]. 

If we put our own voice on each note (as opposed to quoting by copy/pasting), then the most part of the work is done. We can go from content consumers to content producers simply by putting thought and our context into what we write (see: [[hermeneutic circle]], [[lower the barrier to writing]]).
