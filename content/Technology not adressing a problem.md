The idea of **[[technology push]]** for [[technolgy transfer]] means that the [[problem-solution cycle]] is broken. State of the art technology may not address a real problem[@ianuzzi2017]. This happens every time scientists develop new tools that are able to do something no one else managed to do before. The problem will be created *a-posteriori*. 

The biggest challenge is to realize whether the technology developed in the lab is market-ready or some adaptions are still required in order to transform the idea into a product. 

One possible path is to [[create the need for a product]], by educating the intended audience (for example, by creating [[catalytic experiences]]). 

May be interesting to follow up with the [[Treacy-Wiersema frame]].
