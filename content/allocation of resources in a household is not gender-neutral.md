In households lead by women, i.e. in which women have a higher say on how resources are allocated, the expenditure is different than in households lead by men [@criadoperez2020]. This means that when evaluating poverty, one must also consider who is the resource manager of the household (see: [[The zombie stat]]). This is poorly done, but it may be pointing to showing that women can, in fact, be poor even if the household is not in that category.
