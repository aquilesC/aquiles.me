One of the first metals that were used by humanity to produce tools was copper, most likely in the form of bronze, hence the [[bronze age]]. It turns out that copper has antimicrobial properties[^1] that helped storing produce for longer and in a safer way. 

After the war (which one?), more modern materials were favored, such as steel and plastics[^2], but they don't have any antimicrobial properties. Therefore, humanity became less resilient to the spread of microorganisms at the same time copper's use enter into a decline. 

[[Antimicrobial coatings]] are gaining momentum, and are based on a lot of the knowledge generated by people researching copper's properties.
