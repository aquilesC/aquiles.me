# GAFA CEO's testify in front of the US Congress
I didn't have time to check exactly what happened, but I have seen there was little discussion on the news. 

Particularly, a column by [[Marta Peirano]] in [[El Pa√≠s]] [^1] makes reference to the need for empowering European citizens with their own tech tools that don't follow the same predatory practices of the US corporations. 

ProtonMail has also written a column about this [^2] . It has a list of claims by the CEO's of Apple and Google and tries to refute what they say. For example, the fact that the App Store is a market in itself, on which Apple has absolute control. (See: [[What is the problem with the single app store approach]]). It also tackled the issue of privacy, and what Google claims to be a "good approach" to [[user privacy online]].
