In the [[problem-solution cycle]] framework, one should first identify the problem worth solving. This framework includes the mindset of "being in love with the problem and not the solution." 

However, this is not always how it actually works. Some products need to create the problem worth fixing (like an iPhone). 

For scientific products this may be the most appropriate way forward. See, for example: [[Catalytic experience of Biotix]], or [[catalytic experiences]] in general.
