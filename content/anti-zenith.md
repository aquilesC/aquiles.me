The sun is in the zenith when it is directly above one's location (see: [[Eratosthenes Measurement of the Circumference of the Earth]]). The anti-zenith is when the sun is directly below one's location. They are about 6-months apart from each other. In tropical regions, the earth passes the zenith twice per year.
