The concept is incredibly powerful and yet almost impossible to determine with a metric. Perhaps the easiest way of defining it is through the negative[@feld2015]:

-   Myth #1: Product market fit is always a discrete, big bang event
-   Myth #2: It’s patently obvious when you have product market fit
-   Myth #3: Once you achieve product market fit, you can’t lose it.
-   Myth #4: Once you have product-market fit, you don’t have to sweat the competition.

Perhaps the problem is that we try to abstract the issue to a single concept, something we need to thrive for, but that does not necessarily make sense to use if it is so hard to grasp and yet so simple. 

In [@kin], the argument goes a bit deeper, looking at pattern that emerge in different startups. In the end, it is a team building a product, which makes me think that perhaps it should be rephrased as [[team-market fit]]. Can a poor team deliver a product that fits so well in the market that it will make the startup succeed? The other way around is quite clear, even a good team can fail at getting a sense of the market's need. 

Another take at the challenge is done by [@itamar2015b], that uses some concepts of physics to try to explain it: Product/Market fit is like a resonant wave. You can change the wavelength, or you can change the boundary conditions. Adjusting the wavelength are the small changes you can add to your product (or to the [[value proposition-market fit]]). 

The boundary conditions can be regarded as *the market*. Sometimes we can change the market, create a need that didn't exist before, like what happens when you have to [[create the need for a product]]. 

Sometimes focusing on a different market (pivoting) allows to redefine the boundary conditions without having to actually *change them*.
