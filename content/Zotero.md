Zotero is an open-source bibliography management tool. I started using [[Mendeley]] during [[my phd]], when I wasn't yet considering [[choosing technology based on their incentives]]. 

Zotero allows you to define collections (groups of papers), parses the metadata of the papers and downloads information from some predefined data sources. 

Their [[business model]] is subscription-based in case you want to synchronise your library on different devices. 

You can also create shared libraries and give access to your colleagues. I didn't find the feature particularly useful, since you very quickly loose control on what is being added.
