It is another [[agile development]] implementation (alternative to [[Scrum development]]). 

The idea is to match capacity with the amount of work that must be done. Next tasks are queued based on priority. 

- Product manager works with engineering to prioritize. 
- Difficulty for each task must be assessed. 

- Continuous development
- Less formalized than Scrum

**BUT**
- Requires continuous availability of [[Product Management]] to verify task completion and prioritize tasks.
