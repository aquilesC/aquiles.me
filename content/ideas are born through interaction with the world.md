[[Inquiry-based science education]] proposes that students can follow questions in order to learn about the world surrounding them. However, I have found little discussion on the inception of the ideas that lead to a question. For example, the [[basic competences of scientific literacy]] do not include, as a first step, the observation of the world and the determination of interesting phenomena. 

The idea of *playing* is what should create the initial spark, after all, the process of [[scientific exploration and play]] could, in many aspects, resemble what a kid does. 

Therefore, I believe that a [[basic competences of scientific literacy]] should also include the ability of formulating *questions* based on observations.
