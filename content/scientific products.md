I normally refer to scientific products as those that have as core customers other scientists. For example, a microscope will likely be used by a scientist, and was developed by a scientist. 

I think it's important to have a small distinction, since [[science-based startups]] not always target other scientists. For example, if you develop a new drug, your end user will be a person (with all the extra complications around, regarding health insurance, etc.)

Within the [[Instrumentation]] community, there are also some subtleties, like addressing academic researchers or industry researchers. In both cases, [[Value-based selling]] can have very different connotations, since the objectives of both groups of people are different.
