There are 12 standard ways of delivering value, but just a handful are useful for [[scipreneurs]]. 

1. *Product*
2. *Service*
3. *Shared Resource*
4. *Subscription*
5. *Resale*
6. *Lease*
7. *Agency*
8. *Audience Aggregation*
9. *Loan*
10. *Option*
11. *Insurance*
12. *Capital* (buying a part of a company and collect dividends)

When creating a [[business model]], it is important to identify how are we going to deliver value to customers, keeping in mind that combinations are possible. 

For example, a microscopy company sells *products*, but charges a *subscription* for services. Sometimes, they also offer research *services*.

A FabLab could be an example of *Shared Resource*, where you own the tools and charge for access. 

Distributors and companies (like Nikon, Thorlabs, Edmund Optics) *resell* other companies' products.
