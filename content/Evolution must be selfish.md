By thinking about evolution as purely the process through which individuals can outperform their peers, it follows that it must be a selfish process[@dawkins2016, Chapter 1]. The definition of egoistic or altruistic in this context are all those actions that prolong the individual life even if at the expense of the *species survival*, or the opposite. This is because [[evolution acts at an individual level]] and therefore there is, in principle, no positive pressure for traits that benefit the species over the individual.
