# Siloing of Information
When information is stored in such a way that makes it impossible, or very hard, to retrieve while working on an apparently unrelated subject. 

An example would be a customer service employee answers many times the same question about a feature on the product. A developer looking for improvements to add, never finds that users are having trouble with the feature and focuses on a different topic. 

Another situation would be while [[note taking]], if [[notes]] are incorrectly stored, they won't be discoverable while working on adjacent topics.
