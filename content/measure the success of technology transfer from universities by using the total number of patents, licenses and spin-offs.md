Measuring the success (or efficiency) of [[technology transfer]] by using the revenue generated through the deals signed by universities may not be the best metric. Sometimes, there is a very big outlier that amounts to the majority of the money received by universities (imagine being at the other end of the Google licensing). It is possible to use the total number of Patents, Licenses and Spin-Offs as a metric for technology-transfer[@vinig2015]. However, this should be normalized, for example by the total number of published papers (on a given year). (see [[citation-based metrics incentivize competition over collaboration]]).  

With this metric, MIT and Stanford are more efficient transferring technology than, for example, the university of Leiden[^1]. The biggest problem with this approach is that [[patents and spin-offs do not have the same added value]] to the economy. 



[^1]: The paper has some mistakes (numbers wrongly added) and some methodological concerns: For example, they are obsessed calculating the 1%, 2%, 3% as the factor for the total number of published papers, which adds zero extra knowledge to their work. They also fail to disclose how they calculated the numbers of published papers for the MIT and Stanford.
