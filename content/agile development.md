It is proposed as an alternative to [[waterfall development]]

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation 
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

It aligns with the [[lean methodology]], incorporating [[customer feedback]] into future development, in close iteration loops called **sprints**. Each sprint delivers a *usable* MVP that allows to collect feedback. 

- Incremental testing and correction
- Validate customer interest
- Build the right product for the customer
**BUT**
- Higher demand on product managers
- Intense attention on regular basis
- Constant deadlines (as opposed to thinking deeply)
- Reactionary instead of strategic
