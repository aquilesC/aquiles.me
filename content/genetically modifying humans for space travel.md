# Genetically Modifying Humans for Space Travel
Millions of years of evolution made life adapt to gravity. [[Space exploration]] requires exactly the opposite. However, evolution time-frames are beyond human patience. Therefore, it would make sense that a possible enabler for space exploration is to genetically modify astronauts[^1]. 

We can go also one step further and achieve a combination of genetically engineering with access to external tools. For example, changing some neurological pathways in order to make a bran/machine interface easier to implement[^2]. The fact that all this seems closer to reality than fiction does not mean it must be materialized.
