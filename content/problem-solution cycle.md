In many entrepreneurial resources, there is a lot of pressure to *solving problems*. It is tightly assciated with the idea off [[love the problem and not the solution]]. 

This framework, which in many cases it works well, it also falls short when thinking about [[science-based startups]], because how can you [[Love the problem if you don't know what it is?]] 

[[technology push]] companies (like many science-based ones) are pushing new tools to the market because they can do novel things. It is the classic example of [[technologies in search of a problem]]. Doing something better than the status-quo does not mean it will become a successful business, but that does not negate that it may be worth exploring. 

The framework I started using in recent years is: [[literature/202303251644 Jobs to be done framework|202303251644 Jobs to be done framework]]. It addresses opportunities in their context.
