In many entrepreneurial resources, there is a lot of pressure to *solving problems*. It is tightly associated with the idea of [[love the problem and not the solution]]. 

Entrepreneurs are faced with a challenge, since the [[problem recognition]] goes through phases, and there's a high chance customers can't even express they have a problem yet. 

[[science-based startups]] are a particular group, because they start with some technological development they want to push. There's a high chance they don't have the freedom to explore potential problems and settle for the most relevant one. They will focus on [[technology push]] to reach the market. 

Said in another way, how can you [[love the problem if you don't know what it is]]?

In B2B settings, you must remember that [[there is always a solution to the problem]]. When you talk to customers and try to perform a [[competitor analysis]], you will see that people is already doing something about it. 

Recently, I started using the [[literature/202303251644 Jobs to be done framework|Jobs to be done framework]]. I find it more natural to gauge opportunities in their contexts, especially when there are many people involve, each one with a different goal in mind.
