# Epistemic Status
Tendering a [[digital garden]] requires a two way commitment between the reader and the author. In order improve the level of honesty towards my readers, I came across the idea of explicitly mentioning the **epistemic status** of some the notes I write. I found this quote, even though not referring to a digital garden, very appropriate:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Epistemic%20statuses%20are%20lazy%2C%20and%20that%20is%20a%20good%20thing" data-author="Devon Zuegel" cite="https://devonzuegel.com/post/epistemic-statuses-are-lazy-and-that-is-a-good-thing">
I have received a lot of positive feedback for noting my epistemic status and effort at the top of my posts. This is hilarious, because I originally started using these as a hack in order to publish half-baked ideas that I'd otherwise not feel comfortable sharing.

I think that adding a disclaimer to how much though I have put on what I write, and how much of an expert I am in that specific area, can make a great deal of a difference regarding how much my arguments may change over time. Of course, it adds an extra thing to consider, and therefore it is somewhat contradictory to [[lower the barrier to writing]], one of the main goals of this website.

I do think that some topics, when they can be of some sensible nature, deserve an explicit rating of confidence. I do not think that it is required to have a fixed set of levels, that would be cumbersome, but at least a description of where I came from to reach the conclusions of what I wrote. 

I do not think that tech notes (not opinions) deserve an epistemic status. I am still not sure about notes on papers or books.
