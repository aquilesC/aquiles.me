NanoSight was the first successful company that commercialized [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] hardware. Their core technology is the flow-cell combined with a laser head that makes a a [[light sheet]] illumination pattern. In the picture above, the head is behind the red handle. 

It started as an accessory for microscopes and it evolved as a full-fetched product. One of the keys for their success was the emergence of [[extracellular vesicles]] and the challenge to characterize them quickly. 

Few people discuss about the [[Limitations of NTA for Extracellular Vesicles measurements]], and NanoSight did a great job at hiding them, and marketing around the problems. They were bought by [[Malvern Panalytical]] some years after (unclear for how much). 

Today, it's clear NTA has reached a plateau in the knowledge it provides. Malvern is slowly dropping this type of instruments, giving room to other companies such as [[Particle Metrix]] and [[Myriade]] to grab the spoils. 

One of the most pressing limitations of the NanoSight implementation is that it can work with a single color. Changing colors means changing the laser head, which is useful, but lacks the multi-color capabilities of other companies.
