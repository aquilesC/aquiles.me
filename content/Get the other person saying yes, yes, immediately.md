Instead of confronting another person when trying to convince them of something it is better to structure the dialog in such a way that the person first says *yes*. In [@carnegie2010], the author states that when we want to convince someone, we should phrase it in a way that the other person first agrees with us. For example, if they are skeptical regarding giving us personal information, we can start pointing out what would happen if they don't and then having them agreeing from the beginning. 

This is like finding a common set of believes. It may be obvious in some cases, I wonder if it is easy to identify what would be answered by a 'yes' in all cases.
