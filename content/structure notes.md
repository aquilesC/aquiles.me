# Structure Notes
Some notes are meant to be a hub between different ideas. They link outwards much more than what they link inwards. Somehow they can be regarded as theme outlines that allow for a quick scrawl through the content that was generated in the past. They are meant to connect both [[Literature Notes]] and standard notes (see: [[notes should be concept-based]]).
