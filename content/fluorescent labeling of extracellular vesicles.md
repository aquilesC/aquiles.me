# Fluorescent Labeling of Extracellular Vesicles
Characterizing [[EV]]s is of paramount interest for people thinking in diagnostic applications. Measuring the [[size of nanoparticles]] is, of course, one of the features that people look into, the other are the specific [[phenotypes]] of the vesicles. For this, [[fluorescence]] is an ideal tool, because it can target specific proteins within a distribution of particles. The key objective is to study [[phenotype]] or [[epitope]] prevalence.

A by-product of [[fluorescent labeling]] is that [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] can also benefit from it. Therefore a robust protocol can be beneficial not only for phenotyping but also for improve performance of the sizing method. A paper published on Scientific Reports[^1] developed a protocol to study the effect that labeling with [[quantum dots]] has on the final result. They also looked into how some purification strategies alter the results. 

They compared scattering with fluorescence, and they always discussed the same: it is hard to compare since in scattering you don't see small particles and in fluorescence you are not sure whether you are measuring lose [[QD]]s or small particles. They always circle back to the idea of looking at data of particles > 50nm, which is a somewhat artificial method. 

They also discuss the [[limitations of nanoparticle tracking analysis]], mostly given by not being able to detect particles which are *too small* or with refractive indexes similar to the medium. What is surprising is that their data changes a lot between fluorescent mode and scattering mode, but they still conclude that they have shown "good concordance". 

The main open challenge in using fluorescent labeling for [[NTA]] is [[photobleaching]]. It is very different in a [[flow cytometer]] where you do point detection with a [[photomultiplier tube]] than when you do video recordings in wide-field illumination.
