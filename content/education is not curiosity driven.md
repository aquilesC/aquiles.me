One of the problems generated by [[incremental change leads to unsustainable educational paradigms]], is that we generated a context of scientific education (at all levels) that is solution-driven instead of curiosity-driven. This is what leads to [[science in the classroom is separated from the real world outside]], because students care about what happens outside equally (probably even more) than what happens inside the classroom. 

[[Curiosity-driven education]] also means that [[science education should be method-oriented]], while our current system forces that [[education is content based]].
