Since [[it is challenging to distinguish HIV viruses from EVs]] simply by using biomarkers or physical properties (see: [[HIV-1 contains CD9 and CD63]]), an alternative approach is to study the proteomic profile of the particles[@martinjaular2021] that can be harvested from cell cultured medium. 

It is important to note several things, first that [[Tetraspanins are unevenly distributed across extracellular vesicles]], therefore they can't be used as a single indicator (regardless of the method). Moreover, [[the abundance of tetraspanins in EVs can be linked to the sample preparation protocol]], but this is not  discussed in depth. 

Therefore, a better approach is to study cross-correlations between the presence of proteins, which would indicate some affinity between them.

The figure above shows a network plot of the likelihood of finding other proteins given a protein of interest, in this particular case, [[CD81]] and [[CD63]]. This is particularly interesting since it can be used to determine the probability of finding two proteins given some initial conditions. 

Besides the application to study [[HIV]] shown in [@martinjaular2021], this kind of databases can be incredibly useful, and it is available [online](https://evprofiler.bornerlab.org).
