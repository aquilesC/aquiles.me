[[electrophoretic mobility]] is commonly studied in ensemble, which has an inherent limitation by averaging out processes which can be very diverse from particle to particle. Therefore, studying single-particle electrophoresis may open the door to intriguing new results. 

At the single-particle level, measuring electrophoretic mobility requires:

- Tracking the motion of particles with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution

This is where optical methods may be of help (@faez2016). Especially, one can do [[nanoparticle tracking in hollow optical fibers]], which has the advantage of both high-localization accuracy (sub-wavelength) and high frame-rates[@faez2015].
