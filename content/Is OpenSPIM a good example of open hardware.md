The [[OpenSPIM]] project is regarded as one of the most prominent [[open hardware]] examples, and is definitely the crown jewel in the [[microscopy]] community. 

It may have been one of the very first projects that was released not only as [a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2507) but also as a [website with build instructions](https://openspim.org/), videos, and comments.

However, the OpenSPIM is built on [an earlier patent](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search?q=pn%3DEP2107408A2) by some of the authors of the paper, but they do not disclose it:

Albeit I do agree that [[having a patent does not entail competing interests]], the Zeiss light-sheet microscope is awfully similar to the OpenSPIM. Is it licensed from the authors of the paper? 

Moreover, several parts of the original microscope are **badly designed**, to the point where the **assembly of the microscope is not possible** without re-working the tools. 

Even after almost 10 years since the paper came out, these mistakes are online. We tried to submit the improved versions, but the maintainers refused to accept them on the premise that "it is a published paper and we can't change the underlying design."

I used the OpenSPIM as the basis for the [[NanoQNT]], the second [[Dispertech]] instrument. 

However, I think the community should find better examples to bring to the spotlight. I've seen the [[Flamingo project]] sometimes quoted, but that's also a mistake. It is like claiming Raspberry Pi is an example of open hardware.
