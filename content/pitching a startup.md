Every pitch is different: the presenter is different, the audience is different, the mood is different. However, there are some elements that they are always *the same* or very similar. 

For example, there is always a **call to action**, a message that incites people to react. Either inward-facing like "we look for money", or "visit our website", and outward-facing: go to your local council and ask for a change.
