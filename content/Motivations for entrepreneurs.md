The [[Motivation factors for scientific entrepreneurship]] can be related to entrepreneurs in general, or perhaps not. 

In [[literature/@wasserman2012|@wasserman2012]] there's a summary of few 1000's of respondents to a questionnaire, where the summary of the top motivations of male entrepreneurs in their 20's are the following:

1. Power and Influence
2. Autonomy
3. Managing People
4. Financial Gain

Interestingly, non-entrepreneurs top motivations are:

1. Security
2. Prestige
3. Financial Gain
4. Affiliation

Women in their 20's have a similar motivation rank (entrepreneurs):

1. Autonomy
2. Power and Influence
3. Managing People
4. Altruism

I think this last point is an interesting one. Of the few "altruistic" companies I've crossed up to now, all were women-led. 

Older cohorts in their 30's and 40's show more or less the same motivations, while Altruism, Variety, and Intellectual challenge start to appear in the top 4. 

The difference between [[scipreneurs]] may be age-related (most people will be in their 30's when they start a company), and there may be a bias towards the type of person who decided to start a company. For example, scientists are exposed to high job insecurity for very long (unsurprisingly, a very high motivator in non-entrepreneurs regardless of age.)
