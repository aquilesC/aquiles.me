For [[product development]], especially in [[startups]], founders may focus too much on features because that's what they are proud of. More importantly, it may be because they don't know their customers yet ([[Customer Development]]). 

But what makes a user decide to purchase a product is the impact it'll have on their tasks (very closely related to [[jobs theory]]). Those are the **benefits** your product generates, not its features. 

Features are what engineers build into the product.
