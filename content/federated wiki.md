Listening to [[Mike Caulfield]]'s talk[^1], he evolves the ideas of [[the garden or the stream]], into those of a federated wiki. The idea is working with [[transclusion]] between different domains, controlled by different people. The [website](http://fed.wiki.org/view/federated-wiki) has a look super similar to [Andy Matuschack's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org) which probably justifies the latter choice. 

Even though the idea seems good in principle, federating a website comes at risks that I believe where not completely explored. Maggie Appleton[^2] describes the situation quite eloquently:

> We can easily imagine transclusions going the way of the public comments section. The 14-year-olds of 4chan might mass-tranclude the introductory paragraph of a New York Times lead story, surrounded by the incendiary lyrics of South Park's '_Uncle Fucka_'. In fact that would definitely happen.
    
> This system opens up all the gnarly philosophical questions around control, censorship, community moderation, and "_free speech_" that the web constantly makes tangible and visceral.

Therefore, there should be a moderation mechanism and a validation mechanism that has yet to be developed. Transclusion works nice withing one's own content, but they will have the same caveats of [[Web Mentions and Comments]]. I guess the most important thing is to learn from the past experiences, but I am not sure in which capacity.
