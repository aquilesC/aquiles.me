[[Hydrogels]] can be used to mimic the extracellular matrix (which is in itself a hydrogel made up from cross-linked hydrophilic polymer network). 

Particularly, human-made hydrogels can be cross-linked under mild conditions, which means [[hydrogels can encapsulate live cells]][foyt2018]

The most challenging aspect of mimicking the extracellular matrix is that hydrogels are homogeneous, which means they can't replicate the complex structure of native tissues[@foyt2018]. This points to the [[challenges for the use of hydrogels in medicine]].
