"*Social Infrastructure*" should be placed on-pair with other types of infrastructure, such as roads and hospitals. This normally relates to the [[unpaid work done by women]], such as caring for the elderly or children, but also other tasks that relate to the household and are in the hands of women. Depending on the county, this goes from taking care of the animals, to grocery, to domestic duties[@criadoperez2020].

If one would invest in social infrastructure, that would automatically lead to the generation of work for women (for example, investing in child care would boost child care services which are most likely run by women) and it would free up the time of women to enter into the formal work force. This would, in turn, have a boost to the overall economy of a country, and that is why [[calculating the gdp of a country should include the unpaid work done by women]].
