One of the roles of [[Product Management]] is to fully understand their customers, and to develop them through different stages: 

- [[Customer Discovery]]
	- **Proble-solution** fit ([[problem-solution cycle]])
	- [[minimum viable product]]
- [[Customer Validation]]
	- [[product-market fit]]
	- [[business model]]
	- [[sales]]
- [[Customer Creation]]
	- Scale execution
- [[Company Building]]
	- Scale organization

1. There are no answers in your building
2. Pair customer development with agile product development ([[agile development]])
3. Failure is an integral part of the process (because you are *searching* for a [[business model]])
4. Make continuous iteration and pivots
5.  ...
6.  ...
7. Agree on [[market type]], it changes everything
8. Startup metrics are different from those in an existing company
9.  ...
10.  ...
