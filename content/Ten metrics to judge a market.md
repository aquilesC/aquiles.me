When performing [[market research]], we can focus on ten specific aspects that would allow us to judge whether we should jump in or not:

1. *Urgency*: are people craving for your solution? Or better said, how badly do they want their problem to be removed? 
2. *Market size*: The one everyone focuses on. Market reports can be an indicator, but are they actionable? [[Bottom up market sizing]] seems much more valuable, especially for [[scipreneurs]]
3. *Pricing Potential*: How much can your charge for your solution? May be hard to know without talking to people on certain terms. 
4. *Cost of customer acquisition*: This is one most non-digital [[entrepreneurs]] overlook. Especially for [[deep tech]] companies, this cost may be a deal breaker. 
5. *Cost of value delivery*: This includes the cost of building the solution and delivering it to the customer. Even with a [[marginal cost]] approaching 0 (digital goods), there may be service costs, for example. 
6. *Uniqueness of offer*: how different is what you do from what others do? Building a [[Categories of competitors]]. 
7. *Speed to market*: How long is it going to take to have a solution that you can sell? 
8. *Up-font investment*
9. *Upsell potential*: What other things can you sell to the same customers? Associated products and services you can offer to people
10. *Evergreen potential*: How much work you have to do to keep selling? A service requires continuous selling. A book can be sold many times after writing, but a customer will not purchase the same book twice. 

You can assign a value from 1 to 10 to each point. If the sum is $<50$, then it's not worth the effort. If it's $50<x<75$ , then there's potential but it'll require quite a lot of effort. If it's $>75$, then the opportunity should be seized.
