In [[project management]], there's a way of defining key roles that should be known to all the stakeholders involved. It is meant to create a consistent structure to prevent roadblocks down the line, when it becomes apparent that there's a gap in the decision-making process, for example. 

**RACI** stands for:
- Responsible
- Accountable
- Consulted
- Informed

It is used to define roles in [[cross-functional projects]]. 

- **Responsible** is the one who completes the task, and there must be at least one. 
- **Accountable** is the one that ensures the objectives are met and who distributes tasks to those responsible. There **must be only one accountable** person specified per task or deliverable. 
- **Consulted** are subject-matter experts with two-way communication. 
- **Informed**, those with whom there's only one-way communication, often only on completion of the deliverable.
