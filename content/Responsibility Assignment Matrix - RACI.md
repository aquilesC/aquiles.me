RACI stands for:
- Responsible
- Accountable
- Consulted
- Informed

It is used to define roles in cross-functional projects. 

Responsible is the one who completes the task, and there must be at least one. 

Accountable is the one that ensures the objectives are met and who distributes tasks to those responsible. There **must be only one accountable** person specified per task or deliverable. 

Consulted are subject-matter experts with two-way communication. 

Informed, those with whom there's only one-way communication, often only on completion of the deliverable.
