In modern companies, this is often under the umbrella of the [[Product Management]] division (PMO, for example). 

It goes through different phases, such as:
- **Finding** problems worth solving. (See also [[problem-solution cycle]]).
	- In this case, the [[jobs theory]] is an appropriate tool to identify opportunities.
	- Creating competitive landscapes
	- Identify missing expertise in the company
	- Is it a new product or a new feature?
- **Designing**
	- How would a solution to the problem look like? 
	- Not just UI, also what the user does not see. How is data stored?
- **Building**
	- Iterative releases (easier with software than hardware)
	- Prioritization is important
	- It has to be iterative with design. Issues and opportunities may arise that require new design choices. 
	- [[minimum viable product]] to test the core features
- **Sharing**
	- Launching
	- Sharing with target customers
		- [[Marketing]]
			- [[Interruption Marketing]]
			- [[Inbound Marketing]]
		- Focus on benefits, not features
		- Capabilities, not technology
		- Differentiation
		- Value proposition
- **Assessing**
	- What do we do next?
	- How was the process? 
	- Identify strengths and weaknesses -> What can we do to improve?
	- What **metrics** do you use to judge success? Revenue, number of users?
