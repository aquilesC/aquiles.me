# Washburn's Equation
The equation describes the [[flow]] of a liquid inside a [[capillary]] of a given radius. I need to do a bit more of reading, but it relates the penetration of the liquid to time, [[viscosity]], [[surface tension]], radius, and [[contact angle]]. 

The original equation is from 1906, so I assume there should be a lot of work and characterizations done for multiple materials. 

This relationship can be of great help to characterize the liquid inside the [[hollow optical fiber]] setup of [[Dispertech]]: if we can determine the viscosity of the medium independently (i.e. without asking the user to input it), we can have a truly self-calibrating method of determining size.
