In the classic approach to [[idea validation]] proposed by the [[lean methodology]], entrepreneurs must perform experiments that allow to test their hypothesis. However, there's little information regarding the framework used for [[establishing thresholds for idea validation]]. 

Evidence suggest that [[since most startups fail, there's a large number of false positive observations]]. This means that *experiments* are poorly designed, or that results are poorly interpreted.
