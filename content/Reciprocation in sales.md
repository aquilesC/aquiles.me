There is a mental pattern in people, who feel compelled to reciprocate when they receive something. For example, if you get offered a coffee when you enter an office, you feel compelled to give something in return. It may be just paying attention, but it is also likely you'll feel compelled to increase your offer. 

This is a strategy many [[sales]] people employ: they give something up front, because that will ensure you'll be willing to give something in return.
