In many cases papers include a section at the end where authors can declare competing interests, and is normally used for authors to declare if a patent has been submitted or granted as part of the research.

However, I don't see why would that generate any conflicts unless the patent has been licensed. The inventors of a patent get to profit from it only in cases where there are other commercial actors exploiting it, and thus there is an interest not to *discredit* the original work. In that case, the conflict of interests should state that the patent was **licensed** and not merely that it was **granted**. 

The patent-based line of thought would lead to previous papers as potential conflict of interest. *Discrediting* one's own previous work is only damaging for follow up funding.
