# Mental Model
Many people treat mental models as hocus pocus knowledge. They confuse *mental models* with just *models*, check out this [sentence](https://jamesclear.com/mental-models):

> Entropy is a mental model that helps you understand how disorder and decay work.

Or this [list](https://fs.blog/mental-models/#physics_and_chemistry) of mental models. 

I honestly believe this people don't understand what *thinking* means, nor what the *mind* does. We have developed models to understand and predict how nature behaves. The predictive power of a model is what allowed humanity to design an airplane, a nuclear power station or vaccines. 

However, mental models are completely different, they relate to how we internalize and build on the stimuli to which we are exposed. [[Entropy]] is not a *mental model*, but a quantity that was carefully defined in order to predict how *order and decay work*. 

This has nothing to do with how our minds actually perceive disorder. In fact, there is even a chance that our brains compress so much the information they receive that disorder will be averaged out (for example non-symmetrical buildings are sometimes not even perceived as non-symmetrical), or that the only misplaced element is the one that grabs our attention.
