Publishing research involves different stakeholders, with different interests[@ioannidis2014] :

- Stakeholders cherish research from different perspectives. Funding bodies may want published papers, or translatable into applications, or profitable. Different stakeholders may have contradicting views on what research should be. 
- What happens if the *same* stakeholder wears many hats? An academic researcher may be the CSO of a spin-out company, may be the editor of a journal, reviewer of grants, etc. How do the conflicts affect the best interests when wearing the other hats?
