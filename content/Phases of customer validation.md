There are 4 phases in [[Customer Validation]]:

1. Get ready to sell. 
	1. Product positioning
	2. [[Sales]]/[[marketing]] material
	3. Hiring of a sales *closer*
	4. Creation of a distribution channel plan
	5. Refining the [[sales roadmap]]
	6. Setting up an [[advisory board]]
2. Founders get out of the building and show the [[minimum viable product]] to customers. The ultimate test: will they buy it? 
3. Enough product information to refine the product positioning. 
4. Stops all activity to perform a [[pivot-or-proceed]] decision. The company knows how to *scale*.
