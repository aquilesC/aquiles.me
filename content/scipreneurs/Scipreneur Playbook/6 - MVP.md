# Developing Your First Product: From Concept to Prototype

## **1. Introduction: The Journey from Idea to Tangible Product**

- **The Unique Challenge for Scipreneurs:** Unlike many startups, science-driven ventures often require a longer and more complex product development cycle. It involves translating cutting-edge research into a marketable solution.
- **Why Developing a Product is Different from Developing Research:** Research may yield insights, but product development requires translating those insights into something that customers will value and pay for.
## **2. Co-Developing with Earlyvangelists**

- **Who Are Earlyvangelists?** Earlyvangelists are early adopters who are not only willing to try your product but will also help you shape it. They provide critical feedback, are forgiving of imperfections, and act as champions within their network.
- **Identifying Earlyvangelists:**
    - **Qualities of an Earlyvangelist:** Enthusiastic about innovation, willing to collaborate, deeply connected in your target market, and able to influence others.
    - **Where to Find Them:** In your network of colleagues, at conferences, on forums where niche experts discuss their work, or even among the KOLs you’ve engaged with.
    - **Building Relationships:** Offer early access, personalized involvement in product development, and incentives like discounts or recognition. Show them that their input shapes the final product.
- **Case Study:** Illustrate how a scipreneur co-developed a product with a trusted earlyvangelist, and how their feedback shaped the product’s success.

## **3. Features vs. Benefits: A Critical Mindset Shift**

- **Features vs. Benefits Defined:**
    - **Feature:** A specific aspect of your product (e.g., "This instrument uses AI algorithms").
    - **Benefit:** What the feature actually does for the customer (e.g., "This AI algorithm saves 20 hours of manual data analysis per week").
- **Why Scientists Focus on Features:** As a scientist, it's easy to focus on the technical capabilities and unique features of your innovation. However, customers care about the outcomes (benefits) those features deliver.
- **Practical Techniques for Translating Features into Benefits:**
    - **Ask the “So What?” Question:** For each feature, ask “So what?” until you identify the benefit that addresses your customer’s pain point.
    - **Build Value Propositions Around Benefits:** How does each benefit directly solve a problem or improve efficiency for your target customer? Use this to inform your marketing and communication.

## **4. Moving from Concept to Prototype to MVP**

- **Phase 1: Concept**
    
    - **Defining the Core Idea:** Clearly articulate the problem your product will solve and the science behind it. This stage is about research and refining your value proposition.
    - **Testing the Concept:** Engage with earlyvangelists to validate that your concept resonates with their needs before committing significant resources.
    - **Iterating Based on Feedback:** At this stage, rapid iteration and validation with a small group of trusted collaborators will help refine your concept before moving to prototyping.
- **Phase 2: Prototype**
    
    - **Developing a Prototype:** The goal here is to build a tangible version of your concept that can demonstrate functionality. It doesn’t need to be fully polished but must be able to communicate the core value.
    - **Getting Feedback from Earlyvangelists:** Use this phase to collect detailed feedback on usability, performance, and missing features. Don’t shy away from showing a less-than-perfect prototype.
    - **Refining and Pivoting:** Expect several iterations. The feedback from this stage will shape the final product, and you may need to pivot based on insights from your testers.
- **Phase 3: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
    
    - **What is an MVP?** A version of your product that includes only the essential features required to solve your customer’s core problem. It’s ready for broader testing but may lack some polish or additional functionality.
    - **Launching the MVP:** Use your earlyvangelists to soft-launch your MVP in a controlled environment where they can provide ongoing feedback.
    - **Metrics for Success:** Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the MVP’s success. These might include user engagement, customer satisfaction, or initial sales.

## **5. Navigating Common Pitfalls in Product Development**

- **Over-Engineering:** Scientists often focus on perfecting every feature. Remember that the MVP should be lean and focused on solving a specific problem—not a final product.
- **Underestimating the Time to Market:** The transition from prototype to MVP often takes longer than expected, especially if there are complex technical challenges or regulatory hurdles.
- **Ignoring Feedback:** Engaging earlyvangelists is useless if you don’t listen to their feedback. Successful development relies on adapting to insights, even if they contradict your initial assumptions.

#### **6. Case Study: Building a Product with Earlyvangelists**

Provide a case study where a scipreneur worked closely with earlyvangelists to develop their first product, highlighting key moments where feedback changed the direction of development, and how the MVP evolved from the initial concept.

### **Conclusion**

Developing your first product is a multi-stage process that requires co-creation with trusted earlyvangelists, focusing on customer benefits rather than just features, and navigating each phase with flexibility. By actively listening to feedback and staying focused on solving real customer problems, you can move from a raw concept to a successful MVP that positions your venture for growth.
