Today is a great day, because you decided to take action and start following the scipreneurial path. **WELCOME!** 

As you may guess by now, 7 days is an extremely short time for such a complex process. In these 7 days, I only want to give you a short panorama view of the kind of things you need to start thinking about when becoming an entrepreneur. 

The topics discussed in the next 7 days are foundational. 

It means that they must be at the core of your journey, and it is important to come back periodically to them. 

## Without further ado
We are ready to get started, but we will do so tomorrow! 

Today, I just wanted to welcome you to the "7-day crash course". 

E-mails will be delivered every day except weekends. They all have an introduction on a topic, and a piece of homework, which is mostly thinking and writing down. 

## Sharing is caring
If you find any piece of advice or discussion useful for someone else, just forward the e-mail. 

Or even better, suggest them to sign up for the full series.
