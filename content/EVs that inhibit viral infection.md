Because [[EVs and Viruses are similar]] and [[retroviruses]] and [[enveloped viruses]] generate EVs as part of their reproduction strategies, it is possible to speculate that engineering [[EV]]s can open the door to mitigating viral infections. 

In the cases of [[hepatitis a]] or [[hiv-1]], [[extracellular vesicles]] are used to enhance the chances of infection of healthy cells. In the same lines, slightly modified EVs can halt the spread of viral particles into healthy cells[@hoen2016]. It is my understanding that the use of EVs is still limited to diagnostics (see, for example, [[EVs can be used as ovarian cancer markers]]).  

In other words, EVs can be used to modulate host responses (as currently done by some virus).
