The idea of SPIN-selling is to follow a cycle in the dialog with the customer that starts by: 

- Contextualizing the **Situation**
- Learning about the **Problem**
- Understanding the **Implications**
- Evidencing the **Need/Payoff**

The key to a successful interaction is to frame it as questions, in which the other person can identify their context, problems, and implications. 

The flow is very similar to the standard advice when doing [[product validation]], in which the customer must come up with their needs without we impose them based on the solution we have built. 

Interestingly, most of the generic advice is very similar to what was written by Carnegie in [[The Leader in You - Dale Carnegie]]. For example, to start a conversation it is important to [[become genuinely interested in other people]], and to [[be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves]]. 

This note is generally filled under [[entrepreneurship]].
