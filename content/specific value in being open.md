Quite often [[open hardware projects focus on cutting costs]], while there is also the possibility that they can deliver *value* beyond their price. I am still forming an opinion about it, but it seems that one of the most important values (which in this context equates to *impact*) is the ability to reuse and repurpose:

In my case, the most valuable aspect of [[open hardware]] is being able to learn and build upon tools even if I do not own them. I can understand the decisions made and how would they impact my own designs and work. It is, however, a bit abstract, but I do spend time scrawling through projects just to see what they have done. 

Moreover, there is more and more evidence that there is a path for an [[open hardware business model]] (or probably more than one), from the likes of [[Arduino]] or [[OpenTrons]].
