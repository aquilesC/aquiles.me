Time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay: **TR-FIA**. 

It is similar to [[Elisa tests]], but using a fluorescent label such as europium. I am not sure what the "Time-resolved" part of the essay entails. 

**Check**: Wallac Victor 2 (device on which some tests are performed[@duijvesz2015a]) (#TODO)

One of the challenges of the method is that the signal's strength also depends on the number of antigens per vesicle and the **affinity** of the antibody to the [[epitope]][@duijvesz2015a]. Another challenge is that some viruses also contain [[CD9]] and [[CD63]], the markers normally used for the detection of [[extracellular vesicles]] (see: [[HIV-1 contains CD9 and CD63]])
