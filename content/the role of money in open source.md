# The Role of Money in Open Source
Maintainers of [[Open Source]] projects are often not payed to do it. Therefore, the projects rely on a voluntary contribution of time from groups of people who operate under very diverse believes. [[Nadia Eghbal]] explores the role of money in open source[@eghbal2020] by looking at some very specific cases:

- Companies fund open source to increase their image or to guarantee code quality and maintenance
- Companies pay for premium support (i.e. they pay for the attention of a developer, see: [[Maintenance costs of open source projects]])
- Code can be released with dual-licenses, or some key features may be missing from the free version
- Individual donations to maintainers
