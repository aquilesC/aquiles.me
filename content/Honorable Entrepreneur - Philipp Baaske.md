This book definitely qualifies as a *memoir*, that of an entrepreneur who has bootstrapped a biotech from Munich to a global company with hundreds of employees. 

[[NanoTemper]] in an exceptional case, where a pair of scientists manage to find a way of stacking grants and an early angel investor contribution to grow fueled by sales. 

The book tries to find a balance between the *"success"* type of themes and the *"failures"* the founders faced. 

There's a lot of honesty and openness that goes into the story. From dealing with acquisition opportunities, to the challenges of acquiring another company. Being screwed by an opportunistic scammer. 

Philipp tries to stay politically correct: no reflection on having to sit for hours at a Notary who reads the documents aloud, for example, and acknowledges some of his own shortcomings. For example, he explains what it means to be a bad manager, how he managed to push key people away. 

I think the book and the story is relatable for anyone who has ever worked in a startup/scaleup type of environment in which the founders are still managing the company. 

Of course it helps aspiring entrepreneurs understand what it takes and how things look like, but I think most people can also relate to this book when they see how their managers perform, and why they behave in the way they do. 

They are people, and they make the same mistakes that everyone else does.
