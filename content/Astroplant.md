[Astroplant](https://www.astroplant.io) is a project that aims at collecting data about how plants grow in different environments. It is a [[Citizen science]] project, in which data is collected in a central repository and later analyzed. 

Astroplant uses a standard kit that can be purchased, but it is also [[Open Hardware]]. The biggest market comes from schools (see: [[science education]]) that use the kit as a STEM-inducing platform. 

Overall it is a well rounded product, including hardware and software, and one of the few examples of [[citizen science in schools]].
