Costs of goods sold

It refers to how much it costs to produce the product a company sells. It includes materials and labor, but excludes sales and marketing, for example. (It also excludes distribution). It is very closely related to the [[bill of materials]], adding the labor costs. 

Getting the COGS right is fundamental when determining the [[gross margins]] or [[net margins]] of a product, and it can make or break a company.
