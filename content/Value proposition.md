When setting up a new venture, it is often important to first determine what value are you going to deliver to your customers. The value proposition is the central column in the [[Business Model Canvas]] and is, perhaps, one of the reasons many startups fail: they simply don't deliver enough value to their customers. 

In order to frame the value proposition, it can be useful to develop a persona of your customer (see: [[customer journey and touchpoints]], in order to understand whether the product will solve any of the problems, pains, or jobs the customer has. 

- Jobs: what is the customer trying to achieve
- Pains: what are the obstacles to achieve them
- Gains: what do they want to get?

- Products and services: what does it do? 
- Pain relievers: which problem does it solve?
- Gain creators: which gains does it bring?
