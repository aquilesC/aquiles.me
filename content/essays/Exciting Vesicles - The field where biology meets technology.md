epistemic: I have been developing technology for extracellular vesicle characterization for over 4 years
---
[[extracellular vesicle|Extracellular Vesicles]] are a fascinating topic in biology and biomedical research. These particles, released by all cells, are fundamental agents for intracellular communication in complex organisms, as well as garbage disposal mechanisms. 

**All bodily fluids** (urine, blood, saliva, milk, cerebrospinal fluid) **contain extracellular vesicles**, at different concentrations and with different types. 

In the past couple of decades, a lot of effort has been placed in studying how they can be used to diagnose disease and how to exploit them to target the delivery of drugs. It is important not to forget that **many basic biology questions** regarding biogenesis, uptake, and the overall life-cycle of these particles are still open. 

## My Interest in the field
Coming from a [[my phd|purely physics background]], my interest in extracellular vesicles is somewhat tangential to the technology behind their characterization. For the past 4+ years, I have been developing technologies to measure the concentration, size, refractive index, and protein content of nano particles. 

When [[Dispertech]] started, we focused on extracellular vesicles because we believed it was a booming field, with plenty of opportunities for new analytical tools (although we may have misjudged what the field needed.) 

I joined online journal clubs, followed an endless number of researchers on Twitter and LinkedIn (I compiled [a list of interesting profiles](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1656191648404221954?s=20)), and embedded myself in the questions the field had.
