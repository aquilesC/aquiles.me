episemic: the process is still developing, and therefore subject to rapid changes.

Creating a startup is an extremely personal endeavor. It starts with you, your computer, and perhaps one more person with whom you discuss. It can slowly grow, but for few years it is  *you* the only one that makes things happen. 

Moving away from the startup you created and sustained over years is a very tough decision. Particularly in my case, I'm departing an extremely young company, since [[Dispertech]] is still in its infancy: we have no customers, our first product, the [[nanoCET implementation|NanoCET]] did not fly too far, and the second product is barely at a minimum viable product level. 

I got emotionally attached to this second product, the [[NanoQNT]]. It is based on a [[light sheet]] microscope, and I think it can be a game changer in many contexts, and especially for [[extracellular vesicle]] characterization. 

The closest feeling I have to leaving my own startup is that of a breakup. You know it is for the better, but it still does not feel completely alright. Especially because it is a lengthy process, you can't simply stop seeing each other. 

The decision to move forward, both professionally and personally, was taken swiftly, but not lightly. 

Over time, I felt alienated from my own company. Decisions were made without clear communication. And as the team grew, I couldn't sustain it any longer. 

The situation became very taxing, and it prevented me from focusing on the things that were important. It prevented me from focusing on strengthening the skills I wanted to develop, and to empower the team to become the better version of themselves. 

During more than 4 years, I put all my energy into building tools I thought were extraordinary (and I still believe they are). I spent a lot of energy into building a business and a team. 

Going away at this moment sounds like an irrational choice, but one that I had to take putting myself ahead of anything else. 

I take with me an broad range of learnings, I developed both hard and soft skills. I think I'm ready for new adventures, but it'll take me a while to readjust, and to collect myself.
