episemic: the process is still developing, and therefore subject to rapid changes.

Creating a startup is an extremely personal endeavor. It starts with you, your computer, and perhaps one more person with whom you discuss. It can slowly grow, but for few years it is really *you* the only one that makes things happen. 

Moving forward from the startup you created and sustained over years is an extremely tough decision. Especially in my case, since [[Dispertech]] is still in its infancy. We have no customers, our first product, the [[nanoCET implementation|NanoCET]] did not fly too far. 

We started developing another product, the [[NanoQNT]] based on a [[light sheet]] microscope, and I got emotionally very attached to it, I think it can be a game changer in many contexts. 

However, I also felt alienated from my own company. It's very stressful being in a situation where decisions are made from different angles, without clear communication. It is even more stressful when your own team members are accused of not performing as expected under your watch and guidance. 

The closes feeling I have to leaving my own startup is that of a breakup. You know it is for the better, but it still does not feel completely alright. Especially because it is a lengthy process. You can't simply stop seeing each other. 

But I know it is for the better. The path ahead is bright. I have many ideas (and little resources) to pursue.
