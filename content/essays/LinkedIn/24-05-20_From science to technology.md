⚗️ The jump most #scipreneurs are challenged with is from science to technology. That's the true mindframe change. 

Once you have interesting scientific results you want to valorize, you need to start thinking about the technological landscape. What will enable to reproduce your results, to empower others to build on what you've done. 

The first step is to stop thinking about the scientific questions and focus on how to make things work and add value to others. 

And it's not an easy transition. Not at all.
