 “Your startup needs a market” is great advice—until you realize that nobody taught you what a “market” actually is.

When I started, “market” was something VCs worried about. In the lab we thought in terms of experiments, hypotheses, and publications. Then someone asked me: “Whose life gets better because of your idea?” It changed everything.

Markets aren’t defined by technologies; they’re defined by problems. The day I stopped describing our tech and started describing the researcher who couldn’t run their experiment because of a bottleneck—that’s when people leaned in.

What was your first real “market moment”?
