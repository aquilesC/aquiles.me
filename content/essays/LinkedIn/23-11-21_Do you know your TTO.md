🦸🏻‍♀️ There's a large chance your university has an office (and a person) dedicated to evaluating technology transfer projects. Do you know who they are? I didn't even know there was one at my university! 

Although titles may vary, they are traditionally called "Technology Transfer Officers". Recently, it's becoming increasingly popular to talk about "Knowledge Transfer" instead of pure technology, but the overall responsibilities are the same. 

💡 If you think your idea is worth pursuing outside of the university walls, the first person to talk to is the TTO. They are the ones who can help you understand how to get started. 

💶 If you wonder about how patents work, who pays for them, what are different strategies for valorizing your research, the first stop should be your TTO. 

🧐 There's a large chance they know others who have followed a path similar to yours. They may have valuable advice, they can be aware of grants, incubators, and opportunities.
