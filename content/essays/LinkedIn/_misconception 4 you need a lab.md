ðŸ—½ Misconception 4: you need a lab since the beginning of your #scipreneurial journey. 

Setting up a lab is expensive, lengthy, and has a very limited impact in the first several months of a company. 

If you are spinning out from a university, it's much smarter to negotiate access to the infrastructure. 

At the beginning, you'll need access to people more than to a lab. 
You'll need to define what are you going to build. 
Learn how people want it delivered. 
Understand competition. 

Then you develop a plan. 

A startup is a different game. 
Even a desk can replace an optical table.
