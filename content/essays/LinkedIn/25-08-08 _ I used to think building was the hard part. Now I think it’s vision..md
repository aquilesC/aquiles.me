⚙️ As a scientist turned product manager, I believed the hardest part was building. Precision optics, intricate software. That was my comfort zone. 
Then I became a founder and later a Product Manager ...

I realised building is easy compared to **deciding what to build**. 

Vision means making choices without complete information, saying no to cool features, and staying focused when shiny objects appear. Vision isn’t a one‑time epiphany; it’s a muscle you train by listening to your customers and what some call "market signals". 

Iterating and learning is easier said than done. 

Execution is hard in itself. Execution without vision leads to a dead end. Killer teams are those who balance the present, the future, and path in between. 

How do you balance vision and execution in your team?
