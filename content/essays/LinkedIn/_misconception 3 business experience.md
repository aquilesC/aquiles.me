🗽 Misconception 3: you need someone with business experience to start the #scipreneur journey. 

"Business experience" is not rocket science, it's something that accumulates through exposure to given practices. 

The beginning of a sci-based company will have little business and lots of technical challenges to overcome. 

It's much better to surround yourself with peers who are further in the journey, and mentors who understand what you are going through. 

The rest, you'll pick up along the way.
