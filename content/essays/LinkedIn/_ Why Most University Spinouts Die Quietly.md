We don’t talk enough about how many brilliant university spinouts quietly evaporate. Not because their science wasn’t good—but because nobody knew how to sell what they built.

I’ve watched dozens of projects with incredible technology stall out at the moment they needed to talk to customers. Academia teaches us to publish papers, not to draft a value proposition or make cold calls. We default to writing grants instead of building a waiting list.

As scientists, we’re trained to perfect the tech; as entrepreneurs, we need to perfect the business model. The spinouts that survive do both from day one.

Have you seen a promising project go nowhere? What happened?
