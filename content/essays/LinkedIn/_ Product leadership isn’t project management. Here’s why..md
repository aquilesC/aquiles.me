ðŸ“Œ Product leadership is not fancy project management. Project management is about delivering on time and on budget. Product leadership is about deciding **what** to build and **why**.

Product leaders spend more time defining problems than assigning tasks. They navigate uncertainty[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/difference_between_risk_and_uncertainty/#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20risk%20and,Knight%20%282002), synthesise customer insights[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/customer_development/#:~:text=1,out%20and%20talking%20to%20people), align stakeholders and craft vision. They arenâ€™t measured by the number of features shipped, but by the outcomes achieved.

In deepâ€‘tech, this distinction is critical. Timelines are long and stakes are high. You need someone obsessed with value creation, not just task completion.

Have you seen this confusion in your organisation? How do you define the difference?
