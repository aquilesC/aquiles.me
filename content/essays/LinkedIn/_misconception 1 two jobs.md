ðŸ—½Misconception #1: A #scipreneur can juggle an academic job and a startup role. 

At some point in the journey, the startup role will ask for full-time commitment. 
The mindset, goals, and ambitions of both tracks are very different. 

When you embark in the journey, it must be clear since the beginning who will join the startup full time. 

It will ease the relationship with the academic founders (professors, other postdocs and PhD's, etc.)
