ðŸ—½Misconception #1: A #scipreneur can juggle an academic job and a startup role. 

At some point in the journey, the startup role will ask for full-time commitment. It'll become impossible to sustain academic goals with business objectives. 

The mindset and ambitions of both careers are very different. 

During the inception of a scientific spinout, it must be clear who will join the startup full time. 

It will ease the relationship with the academic founders (professors, other postdocs and PhD's, etc.)

Those who remain in their academic roles need to learn to step back and let the company flourish.
