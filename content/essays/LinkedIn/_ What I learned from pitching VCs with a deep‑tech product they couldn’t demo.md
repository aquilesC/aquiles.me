ðŸ’¼ Selling a product you canâ€™t physically demo is a special kind of challenge. When we pitched our first instrument, investors couldnâ€™t see it, touch it, or play with it.

Hereâ€™s what worked:  
â€¢ **Tell a clear story** â€“ Start with the problem, not the technology. Explain the pain your users feel and how your solution alleviates it.  
â€¢ **Demonstrate traction** â€“ Use data: early experiments, letters of intent, pilot results. Show youâ€™ve moved beyond the science.  
â€¢ **Acknowledge uncertainty** â€“ Deepâ€‘tech means high uncertainty[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/difference_between_risk_and_uncertainty/#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20risk%20and,Knight%20%282002). Be upfront about risks and how youâ€™re deâ€‘risking them.

Investors invest in teams and markets, not just devices. We were transparent about what we knew and what we didnâ€™t. It built trust.

If youâ€™ve pitched a product you couldnâ€™t show, how did you bridge the gap?
