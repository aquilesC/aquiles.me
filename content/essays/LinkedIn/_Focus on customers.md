ðŸ¤” Founders should focus more in understanding their customers than in optimizing for the next investment round. 

We are used to seeing accolades when a company closes an investment round, but we are much less used to seeing celebrations when they sell their 50th product. 

As soon as a company is established, a ticking clock starts running: money will run out. That creates a frenzy to check the boxes to unlock the next batch of money. In many cases we focus on IP development, hiring, marginally improving our products. 

But the only thing that will make a business succeed is finding product-market-fit. 

The more you talk to people, the more you expose your solution, the more you are going to learn. 

ðŸ™ˆ It takes a lot of courage. Showing your prototype around exposes you to failure, criticism, disappointment. 

Believing in yourself, your solution, and your team is the best thing you can do. Even if you don't have a prototype yet. Talk to people, sell them your vision. If they don't buy, you need to find something else to do.
