There are scientists. There are entrepreneurs. But what about those of us in between?

“Scipreneur” is a term I started using to describe our tribe: people who love the lab and the boardroom, who want to translate discoveries into impact without losing scientific rigor. It took me years to find others like me. Now I’m building a platform to bring us together.

If you’ve ever felt like you’re straddling two worlds, welcome home.

Do you consider yourself a scipreneur? Tell me your story.
