ðŸ¤“ If I can give a #scipreneur one piece of advice it would be: don't blindly trust any advice you are given, including my own. 

I fell too early into that trap. I believed what mentors and advisors were telling me I should do. 

I was not critical enough to understand that advice is only given from personal experiences and their are inherently biased and limited. 

What worked for me is not necessarily what will work for you. 

Learning from others is a great way to speed up progress, but learning from yourself is fundamental to get better. 

At the start, I got a lot of "you should do this", "you should do that" type of recommendations. I, myself, have a tendency to express advice on those terms as well. 

But the great thing about #scipreneurship is that there are no "should's". 
People find different paths all the time. 

From bootstrapping to going the VC-funded route. 
From moving to the US to raise capital, to staying committed to some geographical roots. 

I can tell you what worked and what didn't for me or for some other scipreneurs I've met. And that's what any other person can, at most, tell. It's a partial experience of the world. Some insights will be more valuable than others, some people are more able to self-reflect and learn than others. 

Be critical of what you hear. 
Be sure that incentives are aligned. 
Do what resonates with your own worldview.
