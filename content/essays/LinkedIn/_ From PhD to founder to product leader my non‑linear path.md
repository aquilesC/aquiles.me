ðŸ“ˆ My CV looks like a scatter plot: physics PhD, software engineer, startup founder, product manager. I didnâ€™t set out with a plan. I followed curiosity and learned along the way.

Transitioning from academia to entrepreneurship taught me that knowledge is only useful if it solves a real problem. Building instruments trained me to obsess over precision; fundraising forced me to communicate uncertainty[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/difference_between_risk_and_uncertainty/#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20risk%20and,Knight%20%282002); product roles pushed me to think about markets[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/crossing_the_chasm/#:~:text=The%20adoption%20curve%20has%20a,majority%20users%20from%20early%20adopters).

This nonâ€‘linear path is my strength. It lets me bridge languages: technical, commercial and strategic. If your career feels messy, thatâ€™s okay. Sometimes the most interesting stories are nonlinear.

Have you taken a detour that ultimately defined your career? Iâ€™d love to hear your story.
