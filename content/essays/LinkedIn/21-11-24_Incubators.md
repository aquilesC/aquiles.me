üê£ Joining an incubator seems like the only way forward for a scientist who wants to become entrepreneur. But sometimes they come at an unbearable cost for the company. 

Not two incubators are the same, their programs change widely, their networks are of different sizes, and their expertise can be extremely different from one another. 

As scientists, we are trained to seek help in the areas in which we lack enough knowledge. Incubators are often presented to us as an institution that can help us bridge that gap, and enable us to move forward with our enterprise. 

But building on your ideas is so different than following a series of workshops. 

Building requires action, learning, and continuous feedback. The trainers, coaches, and mentors must show a great deal of empathy and previous experience. It is so different getting advice from someone who has seen things from the sidelines, from a non-risk-taking type of position, than getting it from someone who "has been there, has done that".

The first thing you need to judge before joining is what the incubator asks from you. Some are free to join (if you are accepted), and there's little to lose except time. Some are very upfront and ask for cash: it's just a transaction like any other would be. 

Some, however, ask for shares in your company. How do you honestly value that? For me, it was extremely hard to justify why would a 6-month program keep a piece of what you are going to build in the next 10 or 20 years. 

Rarely but not impossibly, getting into an incubator comes with an initial investment. That investment buys you the time you need to reach the next milestone, and may be extremely attractive to many who can't afford an unpaid sabbatical. 

If that's the case, be sure the name of the incubator opens doors in your field. You don't want to carry forever the weight of an institution which sits among the shareholders and is not an enabler. How much equity should they receive? That's a tough one. If you are up for some reading, check what a SAFE note is. I still believe is the fairest of the approaches out there. 

Remember that university-affiliated incubators may or may not have your best interests in mind. At some point you'll have to negotiate licensing terms. Who's interests do you think the incubator has at heart?
