👩🏼‍💼 Averaging different advice is worse than no advice at all.👨🏼‍💼

One of the challenges of many entrepreneurs is that they receive advice from many people. From consultants to mentors. From partners to investors. 

And most people average out what they hear. If one says you should bootstrap and the other says you should raise 5 million, probably they'll end up raising 2.5. 

But average advice is worst than no advice. You should listen and make up your mind. Pick one or two people you trust on given domains, and decide for yourself. 

Advice is like lending money: previous success is no guarantee of future success, but it may be a good indicator.
