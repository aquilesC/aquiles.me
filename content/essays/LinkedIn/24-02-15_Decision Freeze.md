ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Have you ever experienced decision fatigue? I know I have. At some point you can't keep up, and the inability to choose hinders the performance of your team. 

When a #scipreneur starts a new venture, there are a lot of decisions to be made. 

They range from choosing the font of the website to picking suppliers. 
Picking a candidate for a position, and deciding which conference to attend. 

At the beginning it is fun, there is so much to do. 
Suddenly, you have an immense sense of freedom. 
Things can finally be how you always wanted them to be. 
You get a boost of confidence knowing you are building something great. 

But over time it is common to experience decision fatigue. 

You don't want to decide anymore. 
You want things to flow, but you can't break free of the circle. 

This happens more often than I thought. 
Things that would give you joy few months before, now are dragging you into a spiral of despair. 

Fortunately, there are solutions! 

Some people will argue about mental models. If it's urgent and not important, delegate. If it's urgent and important do it now, etc. 

In the daily life, things move so fast that it becomes hard to pause and think about what the priorities are. 

For me, the most useful was always to have a sounding board. 
Someone outside my immediate context that would listen and sometimes give advice, or force me to break free of that spiraling situation. 

#Mentorship is an invaluable asset for starting entrepreneurs. 
It's so hard to build a mentoring relationship. 
And it's mostly because entrepreneurs don't dare to engage in it. 

Asking questions, meeting for a coffee and a chat. 
Many people are willing to offer few hours per month. 
But they won't reach out and say to you "I'll be your mentor".

What is your experience with mentorship? 
Both as a mentee or as a mentor, I'm eager to hear your stories. 
Drop a comment if it's something you can share publicly, or send me a DM.
