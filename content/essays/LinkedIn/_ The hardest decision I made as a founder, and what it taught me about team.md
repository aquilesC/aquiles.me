ðŸ’” The toughest call I ever made as a founder wasnâ€™t about technology; it was letting go of a team member who wasnâ€™t aligned with our mission.

They were brilliant technically, but they didnâ€™t believe in talking to customers or embracing uncertainty[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/customer_development/#:~:text=1,out%20and%20talking%20to%20people). In a deepâ€‘tech startup, culture is everything. You need people who are comfortable with ambiguity and passionate about learning. Keeping someone who isnâ€™t on board drains energy and slows progress.

Letting them go taught me that team cohesion beats individual brilliance. Values alignment, communication and shared purpose matter more than another patent. How have you handled hard team decisions? What did you learn?
