🤷🏽‍♂️ **#PhDs** and **#Postdocs** are in a very good position to consider valorizing their ideas through entrepreneurship, and support from their supervisors is critical.

👨🏼‍💻 When a PhD candidate realizes there's potential to translate their research into a product, it's probably by the last year, when the priority becomes wrapping up papers and writing the thesis.

👨🏻‍🏫 When a postdoc thinks it's a good moment to jump into entrepreneurship, they are pressured to apply for the next fellowship, grant, or tenured position.

Entrepreneurship is a valuable career alternative, but it requires undivided attention. And that's when the role of a supervisor becomes crucial.

The best support younger scientists can receive is access to *time*. From extending a contract, to lowering the burden of non-essential tasks, or allowing for part-time commitments at the lab.

Pursuing an entrepreneurial path is a risky move without a support network.

Deciding to pursue the valorization of an idea does not mean the idea is worth valorizing. Spending time researching, talking to people, budgeting, it may all lead to not pursuing that path further. It's easy to feel (justifiably) that re-joining a traditional academic path, or finding a job elsewhere becomes impossible.

📚 That's why it becomes so important building a context that allows young scientist the time to explore ways of creating impact beyond the paper-mill. It's a matter of lowering personal and professional risks as much as tolerable.

Do you know cases of supervisors who have supported PhDs and Postdocs in their entrepreneurial path? I want to hear about them!
