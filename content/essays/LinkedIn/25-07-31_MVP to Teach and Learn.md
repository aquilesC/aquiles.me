# _MVP to Teach and Learn

## 🔥 Hook
I used to think MVPs were meant to impress customers.  
Now I believe they're a tool for learning AND teaching.
## 📖 Body
In science-rooted products, MVPs often fail when treated as mini versions of the final solution. The goal isn’t to validate features but to reduce risk, surface assumptions, and teach _everyone_ involved (including your users) what really matters.

🎓 **Teach**: MVPs can show users what’s _possible_ with new technology. Not just functionality but how your approach reshapes their pipeline, decisions, or outcomes.

🧠 **Learn**: MVPs should expose you to reality. You’re not testing features, you’re testing value delivery. Are users finding _actual_ benefit? Is usability truly the blocker, or is it positioning, pricing, or trust?

As product builders, we obsess over UX, design, and usability (and we should).  
But someone on the team must ask:

> “Are we building a _product_, or are we creating a _business_?”
