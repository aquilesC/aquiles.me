üß™ When is a lab prototype ready to start its product development cycle? I look for three signals:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Repeatability**: Your system performs consistently. We all know cherry-picking results gets a paper published, but a user is convinced if you provide useful results without too much explanation. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Early market pull**: Getting requests for collaboration because of your tech is the best indicator that you are onto something. If potential users outside your immediate network ask for it, it's time to take it seriously. Network enthusiasm (your " crazy quilt") is valuable[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/crazy_quilt_around_a_product/#:~:text=In%20principle%2C%20when%20launching%20new,resources%20is%20in%20your%20network), but widespread interest is critical.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Risk awareness**: You‚Äôve identified, embraced, and de‚Äërisked the unknowns: technical, regulatory, supply chain[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/difference_between_risk_and_uncertainty/#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20risk%20and,Knight%20%282002). You know you can provide results, you learned it is legal to do it, or what it would take to get it approved, and you explored how to build your solution. 

Bridging science and product means more than scaling hardware production. It requires understanding the adoption curve[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/crossing_the_chasm/#:~:text=The%20adoption%20curve%20has%20a,majority%20users%20from%20early%20adopters) and talking to users who could become customers [notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/customer_development/#:~:text=1,out%20and%20talking%20to%20people). 

What signals do you look for when deciding something is worth productizing?
