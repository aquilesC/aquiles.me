ðŸ—½ Misconception 2: Equity in a startup should be split based on past contributions. 

Once a #scipreneur decides to get started, there will almost certainly be a tense moment with faculty members: how much equity should a professor get?

While academia works on a system of rewards to past accomplishments, companies work on a system of future incentives. 

If the people who actually start the company, the ones who work full time on it, don't get enough equity, they will inherently be demotivated. 

The lack of sense of ownership is devastating for a highly uncertain scenario. They become mere employees. 

And investors know this. If a startup's shareholders are mostly people who don't work at the startup, it leaves no room for creating an incentive structure. 

That's also true when universities decide to hold equity in a company. 

Professors need to let their mentees grow.
