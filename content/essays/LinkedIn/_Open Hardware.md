ðŸ”“ Have you already heard about Open Hardware? It's an intriguing movement that is taking a foothold across disciplines, but where can it lead to? 

Open Hardware is the physical space counterpart to the open source software movement. Design files of tools are released openly, and tools are licensed in a way anybody can modify and build upon. 

In some academic circles, releasing open-hardware tools became a practice to increase impact and reproducibility. After all, in principle, you want people to build on what you've developed. 

Sadly, scholars have focused too much on the "cheap" nature of open hardware. Many projects are substitutes of commercially available tools. Leading to the feeling of why would you pay $5000 for something a postdoc can 3D print and assemble in a month? It also leads to tools that underperform because they have to be cheap. 

Fortunately this view is rapidly changing now. Value is placed in the community gathering around common tools and in the underserved possibilities. 

A conference I attended last year opened my eyes to how open tools can address problems in the global south. Sometimes it's not a matter of price, but on the insanely long delivery times, burdens on imports, and lack of support. 

An open tool can be manufactured locally. Technicians learn how to assemble and maintain what they are building. Perhaps it's not even cheaper than bulk-producing in a factory, but it is certainly more accessible. 

At the same conference, however, I heard too often the messianic approach of "we make this cheap because that's what's needed in poorer countries." That's, however, a discussion for another day. 

Today, there are companies built on the commercialization of open hardware. From Arduino to Seeedstudio, to Open Trons. 

Compared to most open source software companies, which sell services associated to the tools they've developed, hardware companies have a more traditional business model. They sell products, simply that. 

I always wondered if it's the open nature of Arduino responsible for their success or whether it's rooted mostly in the fact that it's a well designed tool, with a well designed ecosystem, addressing an underserved market. 

Of course there'll be specific cases: a factory can keep operating even if Arduino goes bust or stops producing boards. They simply read the schematic and build it themselves. 

On the other hand, Raspberry Pi is also a very successful company but their boards are not open. 

Open hardware is also emerging at companies that don't commercialize physical tools. For example, @Arcadia released an open microscope to read phenotypes. It's a tool they  developed for their own purposes, but they are not a company commercializing hardware. 

I believe that, for science-based companies, the open hardware movement will become fundamental to attract talents. 

Open software already has that role: It's not a coincidence that Facebook, Google, etc. maintained large projects that don't directly impact their business (React, and Angular respectively) but that act as magnets for the talent they need. It's marketing for the job market. 

Working at a company that maintains an open project means you can showcase your work. You get a sense of belonging to a larger community. It may be an interesting way to lower the barrier for people making the transition out of academia. 

I believe we are at the brink of seeing a proliferation of open hardware arising both from academic labs as well as companies. It'll lead to very interesting interactions and discussions. 

Most funding agencies don't contemplate open hardware as a strategy for valorizing research. Tech transfer is rooted in patents and licensing. Even if renamed as knowledge-transfer, the metrics they use are antiquated. 

On the other hand, releasing tools openly is still seen as a destruction of the ability to commercialize them. Creates tension between teach transfer officers and researchers. 

The reality is that the majority of the developments in academic labs will never be sold. The majority of the patents filed by universities are never valorized. And it's fine. Commercialization shouldn't be the objective of basic research, and neither should be keeping secrets and hampering others from reproducing and building on previous work. 

On the other hand, if value is created on tools financed by public money, it seems fair
