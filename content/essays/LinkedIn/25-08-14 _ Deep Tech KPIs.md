🚀 **Most startup metrics don’t work for deep tech.**

I’ve seen it too many times—founders judged by KPIs built for software.  
Deep tech needs its _own_ scorecard.

Recently, I came across a framework from ThinkStorm with **five metrics I wish more investors used**:

1️⃣ **SMMI** – Beyond TRLs: can you integrate, manufacture, and repeat?  
2️⃣ **CETD** – Capital per _real_ technical advance.  
3️⃣ **RCI** – How close are you to a signed contract?  
4️⃣ **SNR** – More patents, less PR.  
5️⃣ **TFS** – Consistency over speed.

I believe these metrics don’t just guide investors—they keep founders honest.  
In deep tech, _progress is the only pitch that matters._

Which of these do you think we need _most urgently_?
