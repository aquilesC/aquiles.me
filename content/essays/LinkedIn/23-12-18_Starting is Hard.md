üí° How do you get started transforming your research results into a startup? These are some tricks I've learned along the way.

1. Talk-to-people‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

Yup, that is all you need to get started. 

Leverage your existing network, ask your supervisor for introductions. Do you have collaborators? Reach out to them. Do you know who are citing your papers? Track them down and talk to them. 

Present your results in conferences, engage in discussions with whoever is even moderately interested in your topics. 

The trick is to focus your chats to extract the most information while keeping the other person in the spotlight. 

Ask them about what *they do*, ask them about their context. Showing genuine interest is key to being remembered. 

Open-ended questions are the secret to learning the most. 

Don't push your solution, the focus is to learn if they have any challenges you can help overcome. 

Breaking the ice with people you don't know it's never easy. What tricks do you have?
