ðŸ“¦ Many years ago I was asked a seemingly trivial question: how can you observe the 6 sides of a box at the same time? No mirrors, no moving the box around. 

Every time I asked that same question, people struggle. I can see them moving, playing with their fingers. They always think there's a trick somewhere. There may be a mirror that is not called a mirror? A reflection somewhere? 

When I heard the question for the first time, it came with a very specific caveat: most kids under 7 years old could answer it rather fast. Most adults could not answer it. 

We use the expression "thinking outside the box" too often, while in this case what we need is the opposite. 

Only by being inside the box we can see all the sides at the same time. 

The purpose of the talk was to raise awareness regarding how our world view changes once we become used to thinking like everyone else. 

It's been more than 20 years since I heard that question asked for the first time. And I can't stop thinking about it. 

I periodically wonder what things I can't perceive just because I am preconditioned. 

I have seen this same path in many entrepreneurs: they are preconditioned to see the world in only one way. Sometimes that works. Sometimes they need to put themselves inside the box, but they don't know it yet. 

Many "Eureka" moments are just that: getting into the box and closing the lid. 

Have you ever had such a moment? 
I know I have. 
But those are reflections for another time.
