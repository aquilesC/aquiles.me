epistemic: After seeing many pitches, incubators, and events in the deep tech space, I've formed an opinion

🤦🏼 Guess what most deep-tech founders have in common? They are all men! But we can change that, we 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 to change that.  
  
It's good to talk about diversity, but it's better to do something about it. We need to encourage a diverse pool of entrepreneurs who can tackle problems in varied ways, with different perspectives.  
  
💰 Do you know what is the first thing an entrepreneur meets in their journey? A panel of men deciding whether to invest in their idea.  
  
We need to nurture more diverse ecosystems, and we can't hide behind the curtain of 'we hire the best, the selection pool is biased'. We are the ones responsible for biasing the selection pool.  
  
🙋🏼‍♂️ But we can change that as founders, investors, incubator managers, mentors, coaches.  
  
We need to empower women. We need to give them credit and visibility. Are you a male founder with a female co-founder? Allow her to become the visible face. Are you an investor going for a pitch? Include your female co-worker even if junior. Are you an incubator? Foster diverse cohorts of startups.  
  
Most of the problems reside in that we just don't dare to do something about them. Let's start daring.
