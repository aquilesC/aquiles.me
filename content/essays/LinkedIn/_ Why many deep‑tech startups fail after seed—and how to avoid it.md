🌱 Getting seed funding is exhilarating. It also marks the beginning of the hardest stretch. Many deep‑tech startups stumble here. Why?

• **Long timelines** – Hardware and scientific validation take longer than software sprints. Burn rate can outpace progress.  
• **Customer disconnect** – Founders retreat to the lab and stop talking to users. They ignore Steve Blank’s call to keep learning[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/customer_development/#:~:text=1,out%20and%20talking%20to%20people).  
• **Misaligned expectations** – Investors expect milestones that look like SaaS metrics. Deep‑tech has different KPIs.

To avoid the post‑seed sinkhole:  
1️⃣ **Keep engaging with customers**. Customer discovery doesn’t stop at seed; it intensifies.  
2️⃣ **Set the right metrics**. Measure technical milestones (TRLs), risk reduction, and validated hypotheses.  
3️⃣ **Plan your runway**. Raise enough to reach a de‑risked prototype, not just to file patents[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/difference_between_risk_and_uncertainty/#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20risk%20and,Knight%20%282002).
