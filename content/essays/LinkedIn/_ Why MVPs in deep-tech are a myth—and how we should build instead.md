ðŸš€ In consumer software, shipping an MVP is celebrated. In deepâ€‘tech, it can be a trap. When you're working with physics and hardware, a "minimum viable product" isn't about slapping together a prototype and seeing if it sticks.

Deepâ€‘tech MVPs often misrepresent viability. They donâ€™t account for reliability, reproducibility or regulatory requirements. Early adopters will forgive glitches, but the early majority wonâ€™t. You canâ€™t leap the "chasm" by relying on visionary users alone[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/crossing_the_chasm/#:~:text=The%20chasm%20appears%20only%20on,to%20create%20a%20new%20market).

Instead of chasing a mythical MVP, focus on:  
â€¢ **Core feasibility** â€“ Can your tech consistently deliver the promised results?  
â€¢ **Risk reduction** â€“ Identify and deâ€‘risk the parts that could derail you[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/difference_between_risk_and_uncertainty/#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20risk%20and,Knight%20%282002).  
â€¢ **Problem understanding** â€“ Talk to potential users early and often; their insights are more valuable than another prototype[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/customer_development/#:~:text=1,out%20and%20talking%20to%20people).

Productising deepâ€‘tech means balancing experimentation with credibility. Thatâ€™s why the most successful teams treat early demos as experiments, not products. What do you thinkâ€”how do you decide when your tech is ready to leave the lab?
