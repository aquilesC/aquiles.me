ðŸ™ˆ Confession time: I once ignored a glaring signal from our users, and it cost me. We had beta testers who were too polite to tell us our solution was too complicated, but deep down I was aware of it. I brushed it off, believing the tech would win them over.

I am a strong believer that in the early stages of a product development cycle, you need to find your "crazy quilt": a group of early users who act as design partners. People who love what you build, tolerate the rough edges and allow you to learn. 

But that tight relationship makes them less prone to criticize openly the things they don't like. 

The art of listening to what's not said is what differentiates great product leaders. 

I decided not to listen. I knew we were missing the mark in many dimensions when it came to fitting our product to existing workflows. I failed to openly admit the value we could deliver was not higher than the costs we would impose on users. 

I focused on trying to add value by the metrics I cared about: better resolution, better accuracy, etc. But those metrics had an upper limit that even in the best of cases would not be high enough to overcome the cost of switching. 

It is painful, and it took me longer than what it should have, but now I've learned what it takes to properly listen. 

Once you listen, you can decide whether there's need to iterate or to pivot. That's a story for another time. 

Have you ever ignored a signal and regretted it? What happened?
