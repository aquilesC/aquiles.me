ðŸ”¬ Hardware-based spin outs always struggle getting an MVP off the ground. Building a stand alone instrument can be daunting, but it doesn't need to be. 

One of the biggest challenges in the startup journey for founders of hardware-based companies is that they need to adapt knowledge generated around software and service companies. A crucial piece of advice is to build an MVP, learn from customers, iterate, and try again. 

What works extremely well for software, it's much harder to achieve for hardware. Iterating is not as quick, it's not as cheap, and delivery to customers is much more cumbersome. 

Sadly, most engineering and design students are not exposed to scientific instruments in their careers. And most scientists are not exposed to engineering and design principles to know how to translate a research prototype to a user-friendly prototype. 

Startups face a decision that can put their very survival at risk: outsource the product development to a company and deplete their funding, or focus on validating the idea to justify a larger round of investment. 

The problem with endlessly validating is that you can't anticipate the quality of the results you'll provide. You can't fake the data, and the imagination has a limit regarding how the interaction with your machine will be. 

Depleting your money is risky, because without product-market-fit chances are you won't sell any of your shiny new products. 

The intermediate path is to build the knowledge in-house. I have worked with, supervised, and coached many extremely talented students who can learn a lot from a startup's hands on approach, while they deliver immense value back. However, they need guidance. 

Founders come from many different walks of life, and they may have never built hardware before. There's nothing more daunting than building a microscope for the first time. 

That's when the value of a network comes into play. Use the experience of other founders and the expertise of people who have been building instruments for most of their careers to judge your best course of action. Creatively leveraging digital manufacturing, quick CNC prototyping, and software development can cut the development time from years to months. 

Outsourcing is very tempting but unless you are sure that expertise is not crucial for your business model, it can put you in a dead-end path.
