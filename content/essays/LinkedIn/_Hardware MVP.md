🔬 Hardware-based spin outs always struggle getting an MVP off the ground. Building a stand alone instrument can be daunting, but it doesn't need to be. 

Hardware minimum viable products are challenging because of their multi-dimensional requirements. They include mechanical, software, and electronics. Each one with a different skillset and different approaches to problem-solving. And all must happen in the context of validating a business case in a startup. 

What works extremely well for software, where delivery to customers is instantaneous, marginal costs are zero, and iteration cycles happen in days, may be much more challenging for hardware. 

Delivering to customers is expensive, especially if the process includes a technical installation (as is often the case for new, unstable products). Each new instrument consumes a significant amount of capital. It means that upgrading an existing customer eats away part of the margins. Iteration cycles are lengthy, from design to manufacture, to shipping, it can easily consume more than a month. 

One of the bottlenecks is that most engineering and design students are not exposed to scientific instruments in their careers. And most scientists are not exposed to engineering and design principles. On top of that, the knowledge around prototyping sometimes misses the context of validating a business case. 

Startups face a decision that can put their very survival at risk: outsource the product development to a company and deplete their funding, or focus on validating the idea to justify a larger round of investment. 

Endlessly validating an idea will only take you so far. At some point people need to experience your product. And for high complexity instruments, the user experience will never be as smooth as you thought, data will not be as reproducible as you claim. 

Outsourcing and depleting your money is risky. Without the famous product-market-fit, chances are you won't sell any of your shiny new products. It's a single-shot approach to all or nothing. 

The intermediate path is to build the knowledge in-house. Many mentors and coaches greatly oppose this approach. I simply think that they over estimate the costs of developing products, they underestimate the risks of outsourcing, and they mostly miss the point: startups should focus on their strengths to overcome their weaknesses. 

My advice: build knowledge and outsource smartly. 

I have worked with, supervised, and coached many extremely talented students who can learn a lot from a startup's hands on approach, while they deliver immense value back. They need both guidance and creative freedom. Especially when working with people from fields which are not your own, there is plenty a founder can learn from the interactions with a student. 

Founders come from many different walks of life, and they may have never built hardware before. Believe me, there's nothing more daunting than building a microscope for the first time. 

The first step for a startup is, therefore, to define what their MVP is. 

Customer knowledge will be partial, market knowledge will be incomplete. But those are the rules of the game for entrepreneurs: act on highly uncertain conditions. It is tempting to focus on making an MVP as cheap as possible, but you need to be mindful about the purpose of what you are building. Using more expensive components at the beginning is easy to correct when they are not needed. The other way around, however, is much more challenging.  

There is no single path for building hardware MVP's. And that's when the value of a network comes into play. 

The experience of other founders who have been building instruments for most of their careers can be crucial. Dare to ask for help, and be creative with the way to want solutions to be delivered. Maybe it's not just a one-off question, perhaps you need to engage someone on a more periodic basis to help you push through. Especially if you find someone who is not just technical, but who understands your struggles as a startup founder. 

Now a days, creatively leveraging digital manufacturing, quick CNC prototyping, and open-hardware microcontrollers, can cut the development time from years to months. Dare to make mistakes, learn from them and move on. It's a challenging path, but a very rewarding one. 

Outsourcing is tempting but unless you are sure which expertise is not crucial for your business model, it can put you in a dead-end path.
