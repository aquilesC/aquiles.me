ðŸ“š I like learning. I hate exams, though. And the best source are each iteration of what I'm trying to achieve, or past mistakes. 

It took me a while to realize that many people don't try to become better, don't try to learn from one iteration to the next. They somehow lack a degree of self-awareness of their daily achievements. 

I'm the opposite. I'm always thinking. Every time I organize a workshop I think how can I cover the topics better. I reflect on what is more important to keep in, and what can be left out. 

If I would start another company, I'm more than certain I've learned from the mistakes I've done. I'm aware of the things that worked well enough, and which ones can be done better. 

But it's also possible to learn from others' experiences. It took me a lot of effort to understand how to parse what people were saying and how I could extract relevant information for myself. Especially in the entrepreneurial world: many people regurgitate content because they lack awareness and hands on practice. 

It's definitely not the same building a web service than a biotech service. However, there are many points in common that can be used to learn from one another. Avoiding pitfalls and streamlining processes can be the first step into generating a competitive edge. 

And this spirit of doing things better also permeates into management styles. I've seen plenty of contexts where employees are not empowered to improve systems and processes. They end up doing extra, inefficient work, triggered by "management decisions" who is often detached from daily operations.
