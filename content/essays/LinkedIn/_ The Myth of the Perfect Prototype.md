Don’t fall in love with your prototype. Fall in love with what it lets your customer do.

We spent months polishing a device that was technically beautiful—and completely unnecessary for our early adopters. Then one lab told us: “We don’t care about the slick UI; we care that we can run experiments 30% faster.” That feedback changed our roadmap.

Your prototype isn’t supposed to impress you. It’s supposed to teach you where to go next.

When did a customer reshape your product?
