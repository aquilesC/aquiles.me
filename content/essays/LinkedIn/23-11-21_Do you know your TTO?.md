ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è There's a large chance your university has an office (and a person!) dedicated to evaluating technology transfer projects. Do you know who they are? I didn't even knew there was one at my university. 

In many places they are called "Technology Transfer Officers", although titles may vary from place to pace. It's becoming increasingly popular to talk about "Knowledge Transfer" instead of pure technology, but the core principles are the same. 

If you think your idea is worth pursuing outside of the university walls, the first person to talk to is the TTO. They are the first ones who can help you understand how to get started. 

If you wonder about how patents work, who pays for them, what are different strategies for valorizing your research, the first stop should be the TTO. There's a large chance they know others who have followed a path similar to yours. They may have very valuable advice. 

Do you know who your TTO is?
