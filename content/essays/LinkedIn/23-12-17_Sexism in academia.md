It can't get clearer than this: sexism in Europe's academia is very real. And it happens at an institutional level, through biased promotions and work conditions. 

Sexist policies create

Loss of talent. 
Economic inefficiency.
Scientific output reduction.

Which directly impact the entire industry, they lead to 

Reduced Diversity and Innovation.
Impaired Scientific Progress.
Wasted Public Investment.

Among the causes, the most relevant ones are 

Systemic Barriers.
Institutional Culture.
Lack of Policy Enforcement.

Academia is the powerhouse of innovation. We rely on it to fuel the next generation of solutions for the largest problems, such as access to health and solving the climate crisis. 

How can we expect the academic industry to innovate when it is incapable of innovating internally?
