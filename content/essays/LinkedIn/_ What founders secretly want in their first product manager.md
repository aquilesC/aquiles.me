ðŸŽ¯ If youâ€™re interviewing to be a startupâ€™s first product manager, hereâ€™s a secret: founders arenâ€™t looking for process gurus. Theyâ€™re looking for partners in uncertainty.

Founders want someone who will:  
â€¢ **Talk to users** and bring back unfiltered insights[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/customer_development/#:~:text=1,out%20and%20talking%20to%20people).  
â€¢ **Translate science into strategy**, not just into specs.  
â€¢ **Challenge assumptions**, especially the founderâ€™s.  
â€¢ **Wear multiple hats**, because titles in early startups are flexible[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/customer_development/#:~:text=11,Customer%20Development%20Team%2C%20with%20the).

Your value isnâ€™t in perfect roadmaps; itâ€™s in reducing uncertainty and amplifying the founderâ€™s vision. What else do you think early founders value in their first PM?
