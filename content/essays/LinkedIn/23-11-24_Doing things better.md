ğŸ“ˆ If you do something 10% better every week, by the end of the year you'll have a solution 100 times better. 

That's the power of compounding actions. When you set up a team around an idea, you should strive to align them around a common purpose: do things better every week. 

How can you reach customers better? How can you learn more from your customer interactions? Can you make your product perform better week after week?

Once you build a context in which work compounds, you'll get super linear growth. You don't hire a new colleague to be twice as fast, you hire them because the synergy will allow you to be more than twice as good. 

Sometimes 1+1 > 2.
