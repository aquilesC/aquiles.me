# Patents: A False God?

Startups chase patents like they’re lottery tickets. They’re not.

Patents are important tools. They prove novelty and protect investments… but they’re not a business model. The hard truth: most early‑stage startups never litigate their patents; they build a moat through speed, partnerships, and customer love.

Before you spend months and tens of thousands on IP, ask: Will this patent make someone buy my product? Or is my energy better spent proving I can create value?

Would you rather patent first or sell first?
