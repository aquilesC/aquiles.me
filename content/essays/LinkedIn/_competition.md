🏇🏻 Dealing with competition is not easy when you are starting up. At some point you'll learn to embrace it instead of obsessing over it. 

When I started developing the first product, I did a competitive landscape. I dove into technologies I had never heard before, and built a matrix to showcase in which dimensions we would be better. 

What I completely forgot back then was to include users' opinions into my analysis. 

Claims are easy to publish and build marketing around them. Users' opinions are much harder to change.
