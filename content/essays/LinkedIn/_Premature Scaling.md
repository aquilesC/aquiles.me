"Premature scaling can stunt system iteration". Although it's easy to relate this statement to digital products, teams and companies are systems which deserve equal amount of attention. 

When building products, it's tempting to seek new use cases in order to get more and more customers on board. But contradictory use cases will invariably lead to a deadlock when it comes to iteration. Niche down and grow outwards is the (painful but) normally more efficient way of moving forward. 

And the same train of thought works for other types of systems: those made out of people. 

A team can scale rapidly based on an opportunity. There's new funding available, a grant, or traction from the market. But teams come with culture, skillsets, processes, idiosyncrasies. 

And teams are part of a larger organization as well. Larger teams require more office space or different infrastructure, support systems, etc.
