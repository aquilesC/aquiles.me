ðŸŽ¬ The first struggle #scipreneurs face is understanding how can they get started with a new venture. 

Information is very scarce, there are no playbooks and, more importantly, it is always hard to relate one's situation with the path followed by others. 

And that's exactly what I found so compelling about becoming an entrepreneur: there are no set paths, you make your own, and use others as inspiration. 

The lack of information will be solved over time, as universities introduce courses and incubators improve the information they give to young entrepreneurs. However, there's a lot of missed opportunities by not creating a tighter community. 

Universities can do a better job at keeping graduates fueling back experiences. Not just to inspire the next generation, but to inform about policies and how to incentivize (if they care) the valorization process of their own research projects. 

Seizing opportunities, however, is not something that will be black and white and written on an entrepreneurial book. 

Each one builds a different path: Some get grants, some get angel investment, some bootstrap.

Some target very complex processes that require a decade of development and market exploration. 

Some target a niche application that is instantly loved and adopted by many in the field. 

And then you combine it with a bit of luck, vision, a good support network and a team. The number of paths is almost infinite, and there's no single one approach to having a successful product.

But, the getting started is always the hardest. 

- Are patents important? 
- If I disclose what I'm doing today, can it have an impact down the line, in 5 or 10 years? 
- If I split the shares wrongly, what will happen with the company? 
- Should I collect money first, then get started? 
- How much money? 
- Who will take care of this if I want to stay in academia?
- How do I tell if this is a good idea?
- I need to "de risk" first. 
- Is the market big enough?

It's such an overwhelming scenario, with so much uncertainty. It is all based on some partial understanding of the context.
