You can’t build a business on grants. But you can buy time.

Grants are amazing for de‑risking science—funding an R&D milestone or validating a key assumption. They are terrible for building momentum. I’ve seen teams addicted to the adrenaline of proposal deadlines rather than the adrenaline of sales calls.
