ðŸŽ¬ My first entrepreneurial gig was pirating music CD's and selling them to my classmates in schools. 

I convinced my father to invest in my idea: buy a CD burner for our computer and I would sell copied disks at my school. 

This was before the golden age of music piracy. Broadband internet was not a thing, Napster didn't exist yet. Getting my hands on music was much more pedestrian. 

Once a classmate wanted a disk, I would go to the shop, purchase the disk, and made two copies: one for my archive, one for my customer. I would then return the original and exchange it for a new one. There was a limit to a single-exchange, which meant I had to be smart, either having a lined up customer for the second disk or guessing what would sell. 

The first iteration was cash-neutral, but teenagers all have the same taste. From the second purchase onwards, it was almost full profit. 

I could repay the initial capital investment in few months, and insanely grew my music collection. 

Then, devaluation and inflation hit my country. The costs of my materials (blank CD's and original ones) were all over the place. I had to anticipate future costs, build stock, continuously review my pricing strategy. 

Competition came, but they didn't have such a vast collection of CD's. I learned value of being the first mover in a small market. 

Then broadband internet came. I was lucky of being slightly more technical than others, which meant I could download music without buying the original CD. When others caught up, I was finally out of business. 

Nothing was a particularly well thought. Learnings were scattered. What I call now "first movers" is really an after-thought. I had no framework to understand what I was doing. 

I never made much of that story until it resurfaced in a coaching session. 
Sometimes reconnecting with our past selves is a great tool to reconnect with our values and ambitions. 

So you have any such stories?
