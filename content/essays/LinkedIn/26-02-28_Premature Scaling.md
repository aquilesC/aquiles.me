"Premature scaling can stunt system iteration". It's easy to relate when working with products, but teams and companies are systems which deserve equal amount of attention. 

For products, it's tempting to seek new use cases to get more and more customers on board. But contradictory requirements will invariably lead to a deadlock when it comes to iteration. Niche down and grow outwards is the (painful but) normally more efficient way of moving forward. 

And the same train of thought works for other types of systems: those fundamentally made out of people and their relationships. 

A team can scale rapidly based on an opportunity. There's new funding available, a grant, or traction from the market. But teams come with culture, skillsets, processes, idiosyncrasies. 

And teams are part of larger organizations. More people requires more office space or different infrastructure, better support systems, etc. 

If teams scale prematurely, it's going to be hard to iterate the composition based on quickly changing needs. For example, a deeply technical team can build a product but will have very little to do once it's ready and enters into the phase of maintenance, support, and iterative upgrades. 

A sales team built around early traction from a specific market may have skills around the wrong indicators. It's not the same targeting academics than governmental organizations, or industrial enterprises. Even geographies are relevant when determining where to grow. 

On the other hand, what I never discussed is the meaning of "premature". I don't believe there are indicators that unequivocally trigger the moment of scaling. 

That's what experience, gut feeling, some luck, and restraint can achieve. But FOMO should not drive decisions like these. 

Without the power of hindsight, what signs do you seek to decide it's time to scale?
