ðŸ‘” If as a founder suddenly you become too busy for your team, it may be time to reassess your commitments, and start saying "no". 

Founders get invited to a lot of events, to give talks, to join panels and whatnot. 

It is definitely fun, it gives some sense of achievement and recognition. 

But it is very easy to fall into the trap of loosing sight of what is really important: the company you are building and the team you are leading. 

I have seen founders with agendas so packed they barely set foot in the office for weeks. They rush behind the schedules they've set themselves, like the weekly check-in, the one to one meetings. They have no time to sit down and think about strategy, to deliver the value they were meant to bring on board. 

At some point, as a founder, you'll need to focus on what aligns with your mission. Are you making anything out of the tech events you join? Or are you there for the dopamine of seeing your photo shared on social media?
