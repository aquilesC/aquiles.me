ðŸ¤” I am a strong believer that there's nothing I can't learn. That's an attitude that has been engrained in me since early in my studies. A mindset that I've carried along into my professional path. 

It is a pattern I have seen in many people around me (normally those with whom I get along better), people who strive to keep learning, thinking nothing is impossible to understand. 

There is a fine balance between learning and executing. I like living in the balance where execution of ideas pushes me to learn new things. I still get entangled in some rabbit holes. 

Of course I don't have the same stamina I had 20 years ago, where I could seat for hours to solve few equations. However, I like believing I got better at identifying what is important, and at focusing.  

Before trying, I didn't know I could develop products from the ground up. The flow really pushed my boundaries, but I never thought there was something I couldn't learn. Of course, I wouldn't excel at everything, but I would know enough for a rough version and to guide people better suited for the task. 

For the first product I ever developed, I had to learn about electronic design and custom PCB's (I only really understood Ohm's law). I had to learn the basics of 3D mechanical design, fittings, tolerances (yes, now I know what H-tolerances mean). 

As an entrepreneur, I had to catch up with so many different realities: from regulatory rules, to the voice of customer. From management styles to marketing campaigns. From business pitching to sales pitching. 

But as much as I like learning, I am not specializing. We live in a world where people dive deeper and deeper into specific corners. I can develop and deploy web-apps, I can design and build microscopes. I understand OKR's, Agile and Waterfall.
