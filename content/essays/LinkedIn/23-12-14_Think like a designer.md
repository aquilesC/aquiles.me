👨‍🎨 Learning to think like a designer may be my largest intellectual leap forward in my entrepreneurial path. 

As a scientist, I was used to thinking in incremental steps towards a goal. I had never participated in brainstorming sessions, and had never come across the idea of a "prototype". 

Many designers are trained to work following the double diamond approach: you first diverge, try to understand the issue without assuming, then you define the challenge in a different way. Once you know what the problem is you develop solutions. Small prototypes that will allow you to reject the ones that don't work, and deliver the best one. 

It took me a while to understand the enormous overlap between design thinking and building a startup. 

One of the most interesting things is that you can apply design thinking to almost any problem, not just product development. 

Exploring business models, marketing activities, strategies, they can all benefit from a bit more of design thinking in the process.
