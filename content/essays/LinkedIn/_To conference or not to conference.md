ðŸ‘­ To conference or not to conference? That's a tough question for startups and, fundamentally, for #scipreneurs. 

Conferences are excellent places to meet people, to have chats, to understand what is going on in a field. 

Perhaps more importantly, in conferences you can see what the competition is doing. How do the devices look like, what words people use to explain. During face to face meetings, people will be honest about what works and what doesn't, which is much harder to get than from papers.

They take a lot of time, if you want to have a booth you easily spend thousands of euros.
