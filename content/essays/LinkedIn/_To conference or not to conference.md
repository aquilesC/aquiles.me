ðŸ‘­ To conference or not to conference? That's a tough question for startups and, fundamentally, for #scipreneurs. 

When spinning out of a lab, there is a very high chance the target users of your technology are not the target users of your research. 

What I mean is that probably, there is a gap you are addressing with your technology and products. 

For example, a chemist produces a new material which is useful for a physicist's experiment. A physicist who built an instrument that can be used by a biologist. 

Bridging this gap is extremely challenging, because there is a different vocabulary, different expectations, different ways of working. 

That means if you go to your normal conferences, you'll not meet your target users. If you go to a conference where your target users hang out, you won't understand anything about it.
