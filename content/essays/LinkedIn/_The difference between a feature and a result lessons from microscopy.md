ðŸ”¬ When I built microscopes, I obsessed over features: higher resolution, smoother stages, more software toggles. But customers didnâ€™t buy features; they bought results.

Early adopters get excited about specs. The majority want outcomes[notes.aquiles.me](https://notes.aquiles.me/crossing_the_chasm/#:~:text=The%20adoption%20curve%20has%20a,majority%20users%20from%20early%20adopters). A scientist cares whether they can see single molecules clearly, not whether the objective is 1.3 NA or 1.4. That lesson applies well beyond optics.

As product managers, we often conflate features with benefits. A feature is **what the tool does**. A result is **what the user achieves because of it**.

Next time you write a roadmap, ask yourself:  
â€¢ Who benefits from this?  
â€¢ How does it help them make progress?  
â€¢ Can I articulate the end result in one sentence?

Focus on outcomes and youâ€™ll cross the chasm faster. Whatâ€™s a feature youâ€™ve shipped that turned out to be a result in disguise?
