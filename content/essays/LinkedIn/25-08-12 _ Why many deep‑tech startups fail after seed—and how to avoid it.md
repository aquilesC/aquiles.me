🌱 Getting seed funding is exhilarating. It also marks the beginning of the hardest stretch. Many deep‑tech startups stumble here. Why?

• **Long timelines**. Hardware and scientific validation take longer than software sprints. Burn rate can outpace progress.  
• **Customer disconnect**. Founders retreat to the lab and stop talking to users. They ignore Steve Blank’s call to keep learning. 
• **Misaligned expectations**. Investors expect milestones that look like SaaS metrics. Deep‑tech has different KPIs.

To avoid the post‑seed sinkhole:  
1️⃣ **Keep engaging with customers**. Customer discovery doesn’t stop at seed; it intensifies.  
2️⃣ **Set the right metrics**. Measure technical milestones (such as TRLs), risk reduction, and validated hypotheses.  
3️⃣ **Plan your runway**. Raise enough to reach a de‑risked prototype, not just to file patents.
