epistemic: long musings. I am part of a startup going through these challenges.

One of the biggest hurdles for entrepreneurs is that they need to juggle the short and long term at the same time. On the one hand, it makes no sense to worry about long-term if the short-term can't be successful. On the other, if there is no long-term vision, then we can better do something else. 

There's a mantra I've seen repeated over and over that says "do things that don't scale", but very few people have understood what it actually means. 

## Scaling services
There is a very good example from **Strava**, a social network based on sports activities. People join social networks because their friends are in there, but it is hard to convince *early adopters* because they'll be alone. Since Strava could only work with Garmin watches, the founders went out to buy those watches and gave them to friends and family. This created the initial user base. 

Of course, giving watches for free does not seem like a good business model and, more importantly, it is not *scalable*. 

However, what Strava was doing was onboarding the first users. **The way they were doing it was not scalable**, but that was not part of their long-term plan. 

Many of the examples we find about *things that don't scale* refer to the initial onboarding of users and customers, but not to processes themselves. Knocking on the doors of every house to ask if they want to join AirBnB does not scale. Having an online form to register addresses scales to million of users in no-time. 

Having a CEO deliver shoes and ask each person why are they buying, and what they found of the experience will not scale. But Zappos has no problems in shipping without the personal touch. **The value proposition they were testing had nothing to do with the personal touch**. 

Sadly, many people incorporate the belief of *doing things that don't scale* even if it's going to be a roadblock for the business. 

In an an extreme case, the *things that don't scale* is what pushed Theranos to lie about how they were performing their tests. Using older equipment can be cost-inefficient, but you can prove the market need for your service. Then, you justify the development of your technology. 

Bear in mind that doing things that don't scale and lying to your customers (and even more so with medical data!) are two very distinct behaviors. 

In software-based businesses, and especially in service-based revenue models, the scaling factor seems trivial. For AirBnB having 1 house on their platform or 1 million houses it becomes just getting a larger server. However, dispute resolving will scale as the number of users grows. How that is addressed may be the differentiator between being able to scale, or the force behind stagnation. 

Moreover, there is a very strong distinction between services and products, especially hardware-based ones: The [[marginal cost]] is radically different. 

## Scaling Products
For people working on the development of **products instead of services**, the idea of *scaling* is extremely different. Hardware-based products are not guaranteed to scale, and the leap forward is what may become the show stopper for a small company. 

An example is the use of microfluidics as a research platform. They are broadly employed in fields such as *lipid nanoparticle* fabrication because they allow to use small amounts of reagents and to efficiently test  different parameters.  

However, a pharma company may not care about *small volumes*. They need to produce millions of vaccines quickly. In this context, **microfluidics may not be able to scale to large batch production processes**. 

3D printing is another example. Although it enables for rapid prototyping and manufacturing, it is a process that scales only linearly. If we want to make 100 pieces, we need to get 100 3D printers, or wait 100 times longer to get them ready. 

If our business case is reliant on technology that forces the user of *microfluidics*, or 3D printed parts,  we must be aware that we can only grow linearly: the marginal cost is positive. 

When dealing with products instead of services, the challenges are different. Quite often, people focus on the power that larger volumes have to lower the costs. 

Producing one million electronic circuits is cheaper per unit than producing only one. 

Imaging we have a business case based on selling *something* at a given price. This number is below the costs at low volumes, but quite above at larger ones. In this case we have a very clear situation of the power of *scaling up*.
