You should only do things that *can* scale, even if they wouldn't scale in the way you do them now. 

There is a very good example from Strava. At the beginning they could only work with Garmin watches. The creators of the website went out to buy them and give them to friends and family in order to have an initial user base. 

Of course, giving watches for free does not seem reasonable nor scalable. However, what the founders were doing was onboarding the first users. The way they were doing it was not scalable, but not the process itself. 

Many of the examples we find about *things that don't scale* refer to the initial onboarding of users and customers, but not to processes themselves. Knocking on the doors of every house to ask if they want to join AirBnB does not scale. Having an online form to register addresses scales to million of users in no-time. 

Having a CEO deliver shoes and ask each person why are they buying, and what they found of the experience will not scale. But Zappos has no problems in shipping without the personal touch. The business model was not about the personal touch. 

And the problem is that many people incorporate this belief even if it's going to be a roadbloack for the business. 

For example, Uber started with a manual process to link drivers and passengers. There was a person behind a computer making a match, for each ride. 

What Uber knew was those people could be replaced by software. The strategy in this case was doing something that does not scale (hiring people to do the match) to reach the market as quickly as possible, and validate their assumptions as effectively as possible. 

To an extreme, the *things that don't scale* is what pushed Theranos to lie about how they were performing their tests. Using older equipment can be cost-inefficient, but you can prove the market need for your service. Then, you justify the development of your technology. 

Bear in mind that doing things that don't scale and lying to your customers (and even more so with medial data!) are two very distinct behaviors. 

When dealing with products instead of services, the challenges are different. Quite often, people focus on the power that larger volumes have to lower the costs. 

Producing one million electronic circuits is cheaper per unit than producing only one. 

Imaging we have a business case based on selling *something* at a given price. This number is below the costs at low volumes, but quite above at larger ones. In this case we have a very clear situation of the power of *scaling up*.
