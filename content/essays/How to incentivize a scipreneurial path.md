Many PhD's and Postdocs, sooner or later, will face some challenging career choices. The traditional "academia or industry" dichotomy has now a third contestant: becoming an entrepreneur. 

While many people focus on the *skills* that need to be transmitted, I argue that having a context of practice is immensely more powerful. 

I have experienced that myself. I was fortunate enough to have access to a professional coach during the last few months of my PhD. **A coach I would have never been able to afford by myself**. Through weekly discussions with him, it became clear that I wanted to pursue I highly challenging, intrinsically motivated type of job. 

I was lucky enough that my context allowed me to spend almost 2 years experimenting with ideas. I could count with the support of my partner, no family responsibilities, and some freelancing that would give me some income. If I would have had a better support network, I wouldn't have spent so long in figuring things out. 

So, this is article is my personal take on a very nuanced topic. I am of course biased to my own experiences, but I also spent a lot of time looking around and identifying the patterns that repeat. 

## Skills and practice
The first important point I want to make is that skills are *developed*, they are not *taught*. There is no way I will become better at sports by attending classes, I need to put the hours and effort at practicing. And the same is true for technical and soft skills. 

Doesn't matter how much I read about Python, I got good at it by spending hours solving problems. 

More importantly, I got good at it by **imitating others and implementing their lessons on my own practice**. 

The only way of becoming good *managers* is by having role models, try what we think is good, judge the outcome, and improve. It is definitely less trivial for soft skills, and having mentors, role models, or coaches is extremely important. The challenge with adding *practice* to our lives is that it requires *time*. 

During a PhD we have time to practice and get better with many different things. In a company is exactly the same, just that the practice may be focused on other topics. 

It's hard to become better by ourselves, and that is when access to trainings and coaching becomes so important. A good workshop can shake your preconceptions, can give you a solid base on which to build with fewer doubts. But a workshop is only a moment. The rest is personal effort. 

This is one of the challenges in academia. People who want to improve their skills are generally left to themselves. If the skills tightly overlap with the group, it's easy. That's why PhD's become so good at specialized techniques and methods. Hours of practice plus guided development. That's also a reason why groups rarely change their approach: there is no time. 

On the other hand, developing managerial skills is much harder, even for a postdoc. 

Supervisors are granted tenure tracks not based on their managerial skills, which means **it's extremely hard for a young scientist to find a role model or a mentor** that supports them. Even a highly motivated person, there is no career path that empowers a young scientist to become a manager before being tenured. It's not a linear, continuous process. 
## Entrepreneurial *Practice* for Scientists
And this brings us to the topic of scientists who want to become entrepreneurs. 

I would like to make a distinction here between a scientist such as a PhD or Postdoc who is willing **to pursue the opportunity of starting their own business, as opposed to a supervisor who wants to enable the creation of a new venture**. (This is work in progress: [[Professors can empower the creation of startups without becoming entrepreneurs]]). 

Becoming entrepreneurial is more of an attitude than a specific set of skills. Entrepreneurs are [[Risks in starting a scientific company|risk takers]], [[effectuation theory for entrepreneurs|effectual reasoners]], who want to exert some change in the status quo pursuing new opportunities.

Entrepreneurial practice has many aspects that depart from the daily practices of a scientist. From the identification of opportunities, to the definition of value. From understanding the basics of finance, to building a business model. From marketing to team building. 
## Time is the largest obstacle
**Practice requires time**. And one of the largest challenges in academia is the constant pursue of a different deadline. A PhD starts thinking about their career when it's time to write down the thesis (or even worse, when the contract finished!). A postdoc starts a position by marking in a calendar the deadlines for follow up applications. 

Lacking time and requiring people to **constantly think about their livelihood** is an immense roadblock (not just for entrepreneurship.) 

Giving people time is, I strongly believe, the single action that will create the largest impact. 

And giving time is perhaps one of the most actionable ones as well. Many countries offer different types of grants for valorizing research. But virtually none of them target young scientists. Either they are barred from applying or the entire review process takes so long that is unfeasible for most. 

Universities are increasingly having investment branches, but the requirements to get funding are all over the place: from having a prototype to showing customer interests. 

The resources are there, I'm just proposing to brand them in a different way and to make them accessible to the people who will make the best with them. 

Investing in time is not a new idea. This is what [Y-Combinator does](https://www.ycombinator.com/deal) (500kU$ gives 4 founders at least a year of runway), or what the [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/) program offers (24 weeks individual fellowships). 
## Career sacrifice is the second obstacle
Academia is a very peculiar industry because it does not hire people with different backgrounds. 

You can only move *out* of academia, creating a large emotional barrier to those who want to explore other paths. 

I've seen it first hand many times: people apply to two jobs, one in academia one outside. If the academic job is awarded there is little doubt, regardless of the conditions. With entrepreneurship is the same. With the added conditional that an entrepreneurial path requires to cope with large amounts of uncertainty. 

Sadly, rearranging academic incentives and careers is not a matter of shifting resources from one place to another. 

By starting my own company I knew I was precluding myself from an academic career. In my case, the decision came at virtually zero cost. I was not after an academic career after my PhD, but this is not the case for everyone. 
## How to use time
Having access to time does not guarantee it'll use in the best way. Especially for young scientists, the role of the supervisor has a large impact on the choices that each one makes. From papers that were not finished, to experiments that are not complete. 

The first wise step is to set an **independent path**. 

Professors may *think* they are good at everything. Sadly, I have seen them derailing companies just because they were not humble enough to acknowledge their limitations. Coupled with the influence they have on mentees that can't stand up against them, it's a subtle. 

The second step is to **focus on the knowledge gaps**. 

Other entrepreneurs in the network can provide an immense value to those starting up. However, most incubators fail at securing long term commitment. Instead of focusing on setting up workshop after workshop on topics that can easily be found online, they could foster mindful discussions and mentoring sessions. 

The third step is to **embrace the entrepreneurial practice**.

Entrepreneurs need to think multi-dimensionally. It's not just developing a product, it is understanding whether customers want it. It is not just about what *they can do*, but **building a team** around an idea. It's not just acting on the resources they have, but gathering those resources for the next step. And, most importantly, is chasing a moving target. Entrepreneurship requires constant adaptation to changing realities. 

Those skills can hardly be taught. Only through continuous practice it is possible to get better, make decisions faster. Mentoring is crucial for entrepreneurs because it can be **an extremely lonely path**. Losing focus is rather common, and finding daily motivation can become a hurdle for many. 

**Joining a program** can be a good idea, but it works only if timelines are perfectly aligned. **A rolling** system would be much more powerful. Once you abandon the idea of "teaching entrepreneurship" and focus on mindful discussions then there are no limits to when someone can join or stop. 
## Not all ideas are worth pursuing
A topic which is not discussed often enough, is what happens when someone concludes that an idea is not worth pursuing as a business. 

There are many reasons why someone may not want to pursue a given path. From changes in the personal context, to misalignment between business plans and expectations. It may also be that **the idea was not as good** as originally understood. 

There is no timeline for these scenarios. Sometimes projects stop before a company is established, sometimes the entrepreneur [[How it feels quitting your own startup|leaves a company that keeps operating.]]

And there is no playbook at this stage. Some entrepreneurs find their way into larger companies, some try another venture, incorporating the learnings. 

Someone who experienced the entrepreneurship practice in first person is an ideal asset for early stage companies. 

Startups and young scale ups, need people with flexible profiles. Hiring people with specific skills (for instance, an embedded electronics engineer, a graphical designer specialized on websites, etc.) is easy. Finding someone who can identify opportunities is infinitely harder. Someone who can identify opportunities and has a technical background is virtually impossible.  

Network effects are not negligible, and perhaps the largest value incubators and accelerators bring to the table. Not only for the company, but also for the entrepreneurs. 
## Acknowledging risks and costs
It is hard to avoid the **survivorship bias** inherent to looking at examples of startups. 

However, by taking a less traditional path we are assuming risks that are in everyone's mind, but that are not explicitly acknowledged. And that is why distinguishing professors and young scientists is so important. 

The first, perhaps non-obvious, risk a person assumes is **financial**. Many entrepreneurs start with non remunerated jobs. They spend countless hours looking for investment, prototyping, following workshops, without getting paid. 

The risk in this case is to **never recover this investment**. 

Then, there is the **opportunity cost**. 

It's very hard to put a number to it. In some cases the opportunity cost will be more emotional than financial. For example abandoning an academic career to which there is no way back. Becoming an entrepreneur, at least initially, does not give access to competitive salaries, and whether a founder is more employable than a non-founder is open to debate. 

In any case, whoever has decided to get a postdoc position is also assuming a large opportunity cost compared to finding a job at a company. The reasoning should be equivalent, just that scientists are not used to thinking in those terms. 

And finally, the **emotional costs** of starting a business are seldom acknowledged. 

Startups are a high-stress/high-reward environment. There are an infinite number of things to do, with various natures. Entrepreneurs juggle between tasks of different importance and impact. They grow into that position without a plan. It's easy to let work interfere with your personal life. Not every moment in one's life opens the path to become an entrepreneur. 
## Focus on people
A quick search online will immediately show that **early investors invest in people**, not in companies. 

And I think that is the key to understanding how to incentivize the *scipreneurial* path among young scientists. 

Academia is a very dehumanized industry. When you apply to a fellowship, or a grant, you don't even get to see the face of the person rejecting you. They are "anonymous reviewers". There is no single person who takes the responsibility of hiring the new tenure tracker, it's always a "committee".  

Focusing on people and their needs will be the key differentiator. 

Many projects focus too much on companies, and what companies need. How to overcome the valley of death. And that may be OK at a macro scale, once projects are off the ground. But **projects are are not born without people pushing them**.   

And moreover, it is time to[ give visibility to younger scientist](https://www.aquiles.me/empowering-young-scientists-rethinking-academic-entrepreneurship/). Not everything needs to revolve around professors and their needs, especially not when pursuing an entrepreneurial path.
