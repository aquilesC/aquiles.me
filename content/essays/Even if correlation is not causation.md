title: Even if correlation is not causation

A very common fallacy exploited by people from all walks of life is to show a correlation between two variables and claim that one is the *consequence* of the other. For example, there may be a correlation between sunglasses sales and icecream sales. However, no one would believe that people are buying sunglasses *because* they got an icecream. 

Another very interesting discussion is what happens when there is a correlation between variables that shouldn't be there. This is something that happens a lot when studying human development, inequality, etc.
