epistemic: I have reviewed the stories of many spin outs and the relationships between founders, professors, and first employees

Many professors are slowly starting to wear a secondary hat as startup founders. Perhaps because of the pressure from funding agencies to justify the translation of research to society, perhaps because they understand the value it can bring to their careers. 

However, I strongly believe professors can be great enablers for the creation of startups, without becoming entrepreneurs themselves. 

The idea of being a co-founders is somewhat ambiguous. There is no black and white distinction between what are you supposed to do to be known as a founder of a company. But most people agree that co-founders are the people who make up the company since the beginning, even before there was a clear idea. 
## Co-Founders don't need to be entrepreneurs
In this context, there is another important distinction to be made. **Co-founders don't need to be entrepreneurs**. A co-founder may be someone who finances a company but is not involved in the daily activities. It may be someone who offers guidance, support, and the network. 

In my view, an entrepreneur is the person who executes a plan based on a vision, with a high level of uncertainty. 

We are used to entrepreneurs as those who start independent companies, but they can do much more. Lately, companies started coining the idea of the *intrapreneur*, to highlight the importance of people with drive, who execute a plan based in an uncertain scenario, just that within larger organizations. The skills are the same, the people is the same. The context is different. 
## Professors are ideal co-founders
Professors have at their disposal a fantastic platform for launching companies. 

- They have access to money to *de-risk* innovation. 

- Their networks of colleagues, collaborators, and their 2nd degree network is extensive to different contexts and industries. 

- Their job description gives them flexibility in time allocation. 

- The institutions behind them (research institutes, universities, funding agencies) gives them **a lot of credibility**. 

## Professors are not good entrepreneurs
However, **professors are very conservative and avoid risk-taking**. The entire cycle of peer review, grant approval, paper publishing, forces academics to play safe. If they are too innovative, gatekeepers at every stage [[Science after WWII has stagnated|will make sure their ideas don't progress]].  

Professors see the world from their permanent contract, and they are not used to career changes. Trying a new job is unfathomable to most academics. 

And, lastly, most professors lack a crucial treat that makes entrepreneurs entrepreneurial: they are very good at causal reasoning instead of [[effectuation theory for entrepreneurs|effectual reasoning]]. They first gather the resources they need to pursue an objective, they rarely think how to reach their goals with the resources at hand. 

There are definitely exceptions, but we must be careful with exposure biases. 

If we look at companies started by professors, we will note that it's **extremely rare that a professor joins the startup full time**. It's not just a matter of de-risking enough to make a safe professional transition, in many cases a company will not fulfill the personal ambitions of a professor. 

I have discussed with many professors who lament that because of their contracts, **they can't hold more than a tiny percentage of shares in a company**. They honestly believe that they need to own a larger piece as an incentive to do something. 

I believe that is the wrong focus. If they really want to start a company, they are free to quit their job, and own as much shares as they want. That's the reality of everyone in a non academic job.

What professors need to work on, is in their motivations. If they have a fulfilling job, instead of trying to become an entrepreneur, they can help others to pursue that career.  
## Professors can focus on being enablers
With all the tools at their disposal, professors can empower others to push ideas forward. 

Professors have a vast network of young people who are natural risk takers: PhD's and Postdocs live on temporary contracts on the promise a better future down the road. Every contract they have access to is a risky move, and requires lots of personal sacrifices.
