Copying books by hand is a tiresome activity. If your sole purpose in life is to copy what someone else wrote, there's a big chance you'll end up distracted and letting your mind rumble through uncertain places. In the process of copying, scribes would introduce small changes, either willingly (like a correction) or unwillingly (such as a spelling mistake). 

From one generation of a book to the next, changes would accumulate. Moreover, different changes could be introduced while copying the same source book. Studying a specific copy and comparing it to others, it is possible to trace its history. The changes introduced in each copy indicate the scholarly level of the scribe, perhaps they can even hint to the cosmological vision. 

Several generations of changes would make books to slowly become unreadable, or completely miss the original meaning. The problem was already detected at the time of the great library of Alexandria[@vallejomoreu2019], and scribes were tasked to correct the books and compile *definitive* editions. The absolute source of truth.

In a cave in Bulgaria a group of scientists unearths bones of ancient humans. When they study their genomes they make a surprising discovery: two of the remains from individuals that lived thousands of years apart, show traces of Neanderthal DNA much higher than in contemporary humans. This means that mingling of both species was spread through millennia[@hajdinjak2021]. 

Each time someone is born, their DNA is a mix of their parent's DNA. From one generation to the next, some small, random changes, will occur. These changes can be passed to the next generation, giving each descendant unique traits. By looking at the genome of a person we can understand their past, their ancestry. Even if individuals lived tens of thousands of years before. 

However, changes are not purely random. When passing genetic information from one generation to the next, there are mechanisms that do some fail-checks. There are corrections to prevent extremely radical mutations. These mechanisms check whether the 4 letters that make the DNA alphabet: A-T-C-G are ordered in a way that makes sense. Some patterns are impossible, some are required.

One of the challenges of memorizing prose is that it is very easy to introduce changes. It would be very easy to change the location of an epic battle from the shores of the sea to the footsteps of a hill. On the other hand poems are much harder to change. They have a fixed metric and rhyme that makes them very robust to memory slips. 

Poems are the backbone of the history humans told over millennia. They evolved, mixed, diverged but their core messages are intact. DNA is the backbone of the untold history of humans, and as poems it also evolved, mixed, and diverged.
