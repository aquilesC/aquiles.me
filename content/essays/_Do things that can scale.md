One of the biggest hurdles for entrepreneurs is that they need to juggle short and long term planning at the same time. On the one hand, it makes no sense to worry about long-term if the short-term can't be successful. On the other, if there is no long-term vision, we can better do something else. 

In this continuous struggle between the vision and the day to day execution is when things can easily derail. Premature optimization can set a product into a path for failure. On the other hand, no long-term thinking can also put the product in the path to failure. 

There's a mantra I've seen repeated over and over that says "do things that don't scale", but very few people have understood what it actually means. 

[Paul Graham in of if his essays](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html) is perhaps the one who introduced the idea. Many people take his writings to heart, but few reflect on what it actually means. 
## Scaling services
There is a good example from **Strava**, a social network created around sports activities. Social networks are hard to scale, because the only reason for people to join is having their friends already in there, and the situation creates a spiral hard to break. In the early days, Strava could work only with Garmin watches, so the founders made a bold move: **they went out to buy Garmin watches and gave them as a present to friends and family**. It was their approach to create their initial user base. 

Of course, giving watches for free does not seem like a good business model and, more importantly, it is not *scalable*. 

However, **the process that wouldn't scale was user acquisition**. The product they've built and wanted to commercialize had no scalability issues. 

It is not surprising that many of the examples we find about *things that don't scale* refer to the **initial onboarding of users and customers**. Knocking on the doors of every house to ask if they want to rent an air mattress does not scale. Having a person hand deliver shoes and ask each customer why they bought online will not scale.

Business models with a strong network effect, like Strava, or a double sided market, like airBnB, companies need to find ways to overcome the initial adoption friction.

For the companies discussed above, **the things that wouldn't scale were not core aspects of their business**. 

### Things that really don't scale
The history of **Theranos** is very relevant, because it embodies the perfect example of embracing the Silicon Valley mantras while bringing them to the extreme. 

Let's tell the Theranos story from the perspective of a 20 year old who didn't finish university. 

Building hardware is hard. Building medical instruments is even harder. Therefore, before committing to developing new tech, you can focus on **validating the market doing things that don't scale**. Just as Zappos was hand-delivering shoes, Theranos was performing tests using equipment from other companies. 

As the market was being validated, and requirements of the users were honed in, the company could focus on building their instruments. They had a "guaranteed" product-market fit thanks to all the non-scallable things they did in the past. 

That's the story we would have been told if **things would have scaled**. 

Theranos is a special case, because they were embracing other principles such as the **fake it til you make it** philosophy. Doing things that don't scale and lying to your customers with medical data are two different behaviors. 

### Scaling the business model
Doing things that don't scale have very different meanings when you focus on the core activities of your business. If you focus on **things that can't scale** then you are in the path of failure. 

User acquisition can scale, you just change the approach to an online form. Shoe delivery can scale using traditional mail. However, **there was no evidence that blood tests could scale** as Theranos needed for their business model. 

In software as a service (or SaaS) businesses the business scaling factor seems trivial. There were little doubts regarding the ability of AirBnB to list 1 million houses on their website. I bet no one doubted that Strava could deliver their app to millions of users. Non software-based businesses have a very different scalability framework. 

Scaling a product shipping business such as Zappos (or even Amazon) is not a given. Logistics, inventory management, consumer demand prediction, are not necessarily scalable, and have been the issues that have forced many companies to stop operating. 

## Scaling Products
For people working on the development of **products instead of services**, the idea of *scaling* is  different. Scaling the production of hardware-based products is not guaranteed. The leap forward is what may become the show stopper for a small company. 

Without falling to far from the Theranos example, we can use of microfluidics as a technology which is hard to scale. Microlfuidic chips are broadly employed in fields such as *lipid nanoparticle* fabrication because they allow to use small amounts of reagents. They are great for small batch production and formulation iteration. 

However, a pharma company does not care about *small volumes* when they go into production.  **Microfluidics is a technology which does not scale**.

3D printing is another example. Although it enables rapid prototyping and manufacturing, it is a process that scales linearly. Fabricating 100 pieces, takes 100 times longer than making a single one, or we need to get 100 printers.
## The need to scale
All the discussion we had up to now was on the premise that **we need to scale**. And this is where it becomes important to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic needs. 

**Not all businesses need exponential growth to be successful**. 

If you look around, you'll see many companies that generate employment, that create value, but that are not growing. A restaurant is a prime example. Their space is limited, the kitchen has a finite size. Once they reach a given number of servings a day, they can't move on. And there's nothing wrong with it, lot's of people derive a livelihood from such businesses. 

On the other hand, if the business case revolves around the "winner-takes-all" mentality, **scaling is the only option**. 

By growing our market share we can lower costs and maximize profits. If we are into manufacturing, scaling production normally means using techniques that are much cheaper but require larger volumes. 

If we built our business plan around competing on price, for example, we have no way but to scale. This is true for many business-to-consumer type of products, but not for luxury items, where scarcity is a value generator. 

### Financial scaling
Scaling becomes necessary when companies incur in debt, for example. The need to repay with interests means that output in the future needs to be larger than in the present. If the loan does not create a discontinuity in the company's performance, it'll be very hard to repay it. 

Investment also comes with requirements for growth. Institutional investment (venture capital) will need a monetary return at least as large as what banks pay as interest rates. Increasing the valuation of your company comes with expanding business efficiency and market share in a non-linear way. 

If your business model does not account for scalability, you'll be in troubles sooner or later. 

## Do things that can scale
If you are starting a new business, you should always be mindful of where do you want to go. 

If you start with some unscalable approach, you need to develop a clear perspective on what it means in the long term. Also for your team is important to keep a long-term perspective. If the things that don't scale become too ingrained in your products and processes, you may face show-stopper challenges later on. 

Founders have to perform a balancing act between premature optimization and unscalable decisions. There is a sweet-spot somewhere in between where the path to success lays.
