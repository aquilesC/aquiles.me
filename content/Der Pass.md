# Der Pass (German TV Show)
**Der pass** is based on the storyline of a Danish TV [[show]] called [[The Bridge]]. It's main component is that there is a crime right in the border between two countries and two police, one from each, must collaborate to solve the murder. There are some other slight similarities, but overall, the stories are completely different. 

Der Pass happens in the mountains between [[Austria]] and [[Germany]]. It all revolves around a killer which seems to have a political agenda, and is somehow rooted in the regional folk tales. Both the policewoman from Germany, and the policeman from Austria, have different back stories that add to the complexity of the plot. 

It is only one season, and that makes it a great [[TV show]]. No cliff hangers, no waiting. It was actually designed to tell a story in those few episodes, and I really appreciate that. Most of the characters are well developed and consistent.
