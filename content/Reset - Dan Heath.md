I am really not sure about what to make of this book. I gave it high expectations because it came recommended. However, I feel it is mostly pop-writing for a blog than a book with any kind of insights. I think the index already says most, and the chapters are noise to fill up pages: 

- Find Leverage Points
	- Go and see the work
	- Consider the goal of the goal
	- Study the bright spots
	- Target the constraint
	- Map the system
- Restack Resources
	- Start with a burst
	- Recycle Waste
	- Do Less and more
	- Tap motivation
	- Let people drive
	- Accelerate learning

It is even edited as if someone would directly print a website (with "links" on the pages!) 

The examples he chose are very self-serving, and very superficial. Sure, some people did something, let's write a book about it. 

I think there are better ways of spending time than reading this book, and definitely there are better management resources out there.
