Fluorescent dyes offer a limited photon budget (@fo2020): the fluorescence lifetime limits the maximum rate at which photons can be emitted, and *photobleaching* limits the total number of photons that can be emitted overall. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between amount of photons per second and overall length of the experiment. In the case of [[nanoparticle tracking]], this affects the accuracy of the localization and the number of frames over which a particle can be tracked through fluorescence (see: [[limitations of nanoparticle tracking analysis]]).
