Both [[EV]]s and [[virus]]es are similar in a lot of regards. They both contain genetic material, are covered with a membrane, their sizes, density, and overall composition is very similar. The only crucial difference is the ability of viruses to reproduce inside of cells, while EVs do not do that[@hoen2016]. 

This is especially important for [[enveloped viruses]] such as [[hiv-1]] and for [[retroviruses]] such as [[hepatitis a]]. Moreover, there is a very fine distinction between a virus without the capacity to reproduce (noninfectious viruses) and an EV generated from a *healthy cell*. 

[[Tetraspanins can mediate cell targetting]] and are present both in virus and EV particles. This opens to door for using [[EVs that inhibit viral infection]]. 

One crucial difference between them, however, is whether EV's can spread from one organism to another. This is a very interesting question and apparently is not fully answered yet. Can breast milk or semen contain EVs that move from one person to another?
