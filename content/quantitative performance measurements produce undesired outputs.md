Although it has been a trend for the past several decades, quantitatively measuring performance of people or companies may produce unintended consequences.

When [[measuring performance using single criteria]] it is likely that people will be incentivized to optimize for those specific performance metrics. This is visible in the [[publish or perish]] attitude in academia, for example, which gives raise to [[problems with citation-based metrics]]. 

Of course it is possible to try to overcome this by [[quantifying performance using multiple measurements]]. Of course this will have normalization problems, so it is easy to start building ratios between quantities. The biggest challenge is that this leads to a variety of metrics that change over time and from place to place. This is exactly one of the discussions regarding the [[exchange rate of scientific output]]. 

The other approach would be to use [[composite measures of performance]], which is essentially a clear way of adding multiple measurements, including their weights. Although it may seem a more appropriate way forward, experience shows that this approach creates strain in organizations, and can induce culture shifts[@ridgway1956].
