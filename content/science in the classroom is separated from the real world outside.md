When people learn *science*, they normally learn it in a classroom. Therefore, the knowledge they build is valid only withing the walls of the place where they learned. Extrapolating what happens on a blackboard to something that can help us understand the reality in which we leave is achieved by a very limited number of students. This is one of the problems of [[education is content based]] because [[education is not curiosity driven]]. 

In my high-school physics classes I tried to overcome this by linking the electric consumption in students' houses with the amount of water that flows through a dam (which the students visited earlier in the year). The same can be applicable to a chemistry class (burning of fossil fuels), or to a biology class (the energy that sustains life, etc.)

I believe that the current situation was generated because [[incremental change leads to unsustainable educational paradigms]]. But there are some possible changes. First, [[science education should not distinguish disciplines]]. Secondly, [[science education should be method-oriented]].
