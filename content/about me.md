# About Aquiles

	![Aquiles Carattino](/Aquiles_Carattino.jpg)

My name is **Aquiles Carattino**. I am a physicist who decided to resign to a PhD opportunity in my home country to work in industry for a year. Later, I moved to The Netherlands to start [[my phd|a PhD]]. Once done, it was time to move out of academia. I decided to start my own business, you can find more information on the [[things I've done]]. 

Currently I am working full time at [[Dispertech]], a small startup based in Amsterdam. I co-founded the company in 2019 and the scope is to build solutions for researchers in different fields of the life-sciences. Currently we are focusing on two main areas: [[extracellular vesicle]] research and [[nanomedicine]].

Besides my scientific interests in the topics of microscopy, optics, and nanoparticles, I always enjoyed programming. From Instrumentation software to websites. I am concerned with, what I consider, are the major challenges of my generation: climate and the environment (see: [[Klimaat Helpdesk]]), online privacy (see: [[Privalytics]]), digital education (see: [[building courses as knowledge trees]]). 

I think and discuss about many topics, including: [[open source]], [[technology transfer]], [[user privacy online]], and, generally speaking, [[how to make a better world]]. If you want to reach out, you can always grab my attention on a Friday afternoon to [[Talk to Me]]. 

## Free Time and Hobbies
Of course, not everything in my life is about thinking solely about the biggest problems and challenges. As any healthy person, I do have hobbies and interests that sometimes do not overlap with my professional interests. I dance [[Tango]]. I like building websites, such as this one (see: [[how i built this website]]). I like programming in [[Python for the Lab|Python]], and recently started picking up sailing.
