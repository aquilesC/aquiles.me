Defining a single metric to measure the performance of a person or of a company will incentivize people to behave in ways that may not be aligned with the ultimate goals of the organization[@ridgway1956]. 

In academia this is visible with the [[problems with citation-based metrics]], because [[citation-based metrics incentivize competition over collaboration]], and incentivize people to work in non risky fields (see: [[Scientific Exploration and Play]]).

There is an interesting anecdote in India, in which the British government offered money for dead cobras, as a way of eradicating them from cities. This, however, led people to breed them in order to collect the bounty, exactly the opposite from what the government wanted. This is called [the cobra effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect)

There is a fun a anecdote of a programmer working for the Lisa project, Bill Atikinson, that submitted -2000 lines of code when he had to submit his monthly progress report[@hertzfeld1982]. Shortly after, they stopped asking for the number of lines contributed. 

In companies, some of the single-metrics that can be used are cost-per-product, profitability, overall production over set periods, like a month, and therefore neglecting maintenance, for example.
