Defining a single metric to measure the performance of a person or of a company will incentivize people to behave in ways that may not be aligned with the ultimate goals of the organization[@ridgway1956]. 



In academia the problem is visible with the [[problems with citation-based metrics]]. Mostly because [[citation-based metrics incentivize competition over collaboration]], and incentivize people to work in non risky fields (see: [[Scientific Exploration and Play]]).

There is an interesting anecdote in India, in which the British government offered money for dead cobras as a way of eradicating them from cities. This, however, led people to breed them in order to collect the bounty, exactly the opposite from what the government wanted. This is called [the cobra effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect).

There is an anecdote about the [[Negative 2000 lines of code]] of Bill Atkinson that forced managers to change their approach at judging contributions. 

In companies, some of the single-metrics that can be used are cost-per-product, profitability, overall production over set periods, like a month, and therefore neglecting maintenance, for example. 

This is something that is also discussed in [[Build - Tony Fadell]], regarding the [[incentives of sales teams]] that may be too short-sighted.
