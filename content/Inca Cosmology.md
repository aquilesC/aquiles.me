# Inca Cosmology

Inca cosmology can be traced back to the [[Chavín de Huantar]] [@j.mckimmalville2010]. The presence of [[huacas]] can be traced back to that period. They share some common features through millennia. Importantly, the combination of [[the three worlds of the andean cosmos]].

Every known instance of Inca astronomy appears to be associated with huacas and a form of public or private ceremony[@j.mckimmalville2010]. Many buildings are aligned with the sun. For example in Machu Picchu, Torreón: June-solstice, Templo del Cóndor: [[anti-zenith]] sunrise, Intimachay: December solstice. 

The [[Huaca of Chankillo]] may be marking the solar path through a year. The 13 towers are aligned according to the position of sunrises/sunsets along the year. 

- Had astronomy a higher role in the Inca society?
- Dow we need [[literature/202101311220 a new ontology to understand Inca Cosmology]]?
