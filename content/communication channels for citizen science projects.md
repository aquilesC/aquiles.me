One of the core resources of a [[Citizen science]] project is access to a community of individuals who are engaged in the activities of the program. And sustaining a community requires a high-level of sophistication regarding communication efforts. 

In one project run in Spain (Life+Respira), the analysis of the behavior of volunteers shows that the most effective channel for communicating was e-mail[@sanchez-blanco2019], although traditional media was a reasonably effective path to raise awareness about the project. 

I think that e-mail connections is the epitome of the [[Dark Forest Theory]]. Although I don't know the age distribution of the participants in Life+Respira, I do think that e-mail allow for a private communication that is highly valued, as opposed to the public 2-N way communication that social networks promote.
