Prostate cancer was the most frequent type of cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer deaths[@ramirez-garrastacho2021]. Currently, metastatic disease is incurable. 

Prostate cancer is classified as: 
- Localised
    - Further subdivided based on [[PSA]] levels, ISUP grade, Gleason score, clinical TNM stage
- Locally advanced
- Metastatic disease

Over diagnosis and over treatment are problems when using [[PSA]] as a marker[@ramirez-garrastacho2021] which leads to the exploration of alternatives, such as the use of [[Extracellular vesicles as markers for prostate cancer]], or the study of [[circulating tumor cells for prostate cancer diagnosis]].
