Blood has a plethora of elements beyond [[extracellular vesicles]]. The biggest challenge is the separation of the [[lipoproteins]] that can overwhelm the study of vesicles (they can be 100-fold more abundant). Moreover, EVs are mostly derived from platelets, red blood cells, and leucocytes. 

Most challenging still is that platelets can be activated during blood collection, handling, and storage. Release of EVs can therefore confound the results[@ramirez-garrastacho2021]. 

Again, this relates to the challenge of [[EV isolation and purification]]
