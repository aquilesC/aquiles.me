# The Golden Circle
[[Simon Sinek]] presents in [[Start with Why]] the idea of the golden circle as a tool to shape the way companies present and define themselves. The idea is that innovative companies start with why, build to how, and finish with what. In the book, Sinek only presents the example of Apple, which makes it quite lame and also badly researched. 

It connects with the previous chapter, in which he talks about how [[manipulations don't create loyalty]], and made me wonder whether [[The golden circle is a form of manipulation]].
