A possible [[open hardware business model]] is to provide specialty parts and tools that can't be found elsewhere[@pearce2017]. For example, even if a project is [[open hardware]] it may still require a crystal which is hard to grow, or parts in a material hard to source. 

In this discussion, however, there are some clear problems. First, if the custom parts are also open-hardware there is no way of protecting ourselves from the competition in a traditional business model. If they are not open-hardware, then we are building a traditional business and the *open* component is only anecdotal. 

[OpenPCR](https://openpcr.org/) is an interesting case, since they have an open machine and some of their reactives are openly licensed, to prevent vendor lock-in. 

In the software world this would be equivalent to what Wordpress does, for example. To tool is open-source but Wordpress.com offers the top-notch hosting, which would be too hard to configure for a lot of people. It's slightly borderline with [[Selling open-hardware services]].
