There are many [[Reasons why scientists are not entrepreneurs]], but there are still few cases of successful entrepreneurs. There is a distinction that is often neglected (especially when reflected by professors[@ianuzzi2017]) that [[entrepreneurship for a PI is very different than for a PhD or postdoc]]. 

However, it is worth discussing, broadly, several topics, such as:

- [[Motivation factors for scientific entrepreneurship]]
- [[Risks in starting a scientific company]]
- [[Technology not addressing a problem]]
- [[Market requests for a technology]]
