Right now, I have fundamentally stopped using Google to search for answers. I know I can make a complete sentence on [[ChatGPT]] and it'll perform a search and categorization much better and faster than what I could have done. 

I am discovering services and companies through these new services. 

I assume I am not the only one doing it, which means the secret for [[Marketing]] (and especially for [[Inbound Marketing]]) is to get content that is displayed by large language models. 

As far as I understand it, especially with ChatGPT, the provider of results is Bing (under the hood). This means that suddenly the tool of Microsoft has been revalorized to new heights. 

While ChatGPT and other LLM's don't introduce the idea of "paid results" (unlikely, but not impossible), I imagine we'll see the raise of "LLM-Search optimization" as a critical path for expanding the impact of what we offer.
