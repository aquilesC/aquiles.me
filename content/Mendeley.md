Mendeley is owned by Elsevier. That is enough information for me to stop using it as a bibliography manager. I have switched to [[Zotero]] a long time ago, and looking back, I should have always used it. 

One of my biggest objections with this piece of software is how much information is syphoned back to Elsevier in order to build *bibliography metrics*. They suddenly have access to my entire interest tree, and can tune the offer of papers based on their own pool of journals. 

Since I have been paying attention to [[Choosing technology based on their incentives]], I have never gone back to Mendeley.
