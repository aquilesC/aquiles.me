# Hiring a copy editor for python for the lab
I have mixed feeling regarding the outcome of finding someone on [[upwork]]. However, there is nothing to loose by just trying. So I decided to give it a shot and look for a [[copy-editor]] for [[Python for the Lab]]. The thing that made me hesitant was that the people with a bit of experience had no clue about what it meant *plain text files*. The book is written in [[Latex]] and I didn't want people messing up with the code, or trying to parse comments on a shared google drive doc.

One day, however, I got a message from [Jaya](https://github.com/jayascript), who happens to be also a collaborator of [[Real Python]], knows Python, and has a profile on Github. It couldn't be a better match. She has started to work on the book, the first pull request has arrived. I am happy.
