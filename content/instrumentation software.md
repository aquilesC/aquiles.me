When working with measurement instruments, it is unavoidable to need appropriate software. Either for [[lab automation]], [[data acquisition]], or [[experiment control]]. 

Although the field has been dominated by [[LabView]] and [[National Instruments]], the past 10 years have seen a surge in people working with [[Python]] to address their challenges. The problem is that most people lack tools to get started efficiently. 

From a theoretical standpoint, there is little discussion regarding different approaches to instrument control. From [[functional or imperative programming]], the modeling the architecture via the [[actor model]], the [[model view controller]], or the [[device experiment view]]. 

I have been working for a long time in the space, and while I am thinking deeply, there are many caveats that escape my understanding. [[Python for the Lab]] has triggered some discussions, but definitely not deep enough.
