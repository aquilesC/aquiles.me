ELISA stands for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay[@maghsoudlou2016]. There are essentially 4 types of tests, I take the description and figures from[@maghsoudlou2016]

## Direct ELISA

In which the *antigen* (i.e. the particle that wants to be studied) binds to the substrate. This is achieved through plain surface charge interactions, which means that the medium must be controlled (the Ph). 

Adding buffer guarantees that empty sites are blocked, and the antibody is added to create the antigen-antibody link. The antibody has an enzyme that interacts with the *substrate*, effectively changing color and thus enabling the detection of the target antigen.

## Indirect ELISA

Very similar to the direct ELISA but this time instead of directly using an antibody with an enzyme, first a *primary antibody* is used and then a secondary antibody with an enzyme is used. The detection method is the same but also allows to add a fluorescent marker, transforming the test into a *FLISA*.
