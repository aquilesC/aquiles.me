A critical aspect of companies is to create share understandings on how to work together. Many people abuse some concepts (probably because of ignorance) and poorly chosen names don't help. 

An [[MVP]] is a crucial step of the [[product development]] cycle, and it is critical for [[startups]] in search for funding and customers. 

An aspect which is often forgotten is the idea of **delivering value**. 

I had a discussion with the software team who built an MVP and are frustrated because our internal users don't want to adopt it. The crux of the issue is that they built something that works but brings no value. 

With the wrong understanding of what an "MVP" is, they created a roadmap towards "something that works". 

I strongly believe that making the "value" part of the standard vocabulary will transform how we approach the same problems.
