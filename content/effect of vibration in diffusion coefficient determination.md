In [@catipovic2013], the authors added a drift of 200nm/s and vibrational noise with a standard deviation of 100nm to estimate whether it has any effect on the quality of the measurement of the diffusion coefficient. When [[calculating diffusion coefficient from jump statistics]] it gives a $D$ 11% larger, while [[Calculating diffusion coefficient from mean squared displacement data]] gives a $D$ 18% larger. When the drift is increased to around $1\mu m/s$ then the result **can be off by a factor 10 or more!** 

Therefore, the most important source of uncertainty that people must consider is the drift, which is hard to remove if there is evaporation, or any other kind of fluid flow. 

Regarding vibration, in [@ernst2013], they observed that the residual vibration of their piezos was generating errors when calculating the [[mean squared displacement]] at the minimal time-delay, which forced them to disregard the data with the shortest time-delay.
