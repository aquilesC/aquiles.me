# The Future We Choose
Written by [[Christina Figueres]] and [[Tom Rivett-Carnac]]

These are the notes I took while reading the book:
- [[The world in 2050 if we don't stop the heating]]
- [[The world in 2050 if we commit to lowering the heating]]
- [[10 actions regarding climate change]]

## General impressions of the book
Both authors participated in the negotiations of the Paris agreement. I was expecting a bit more of insight about the negotiations, but they only use some events as examples. On the other hand as a book discussing policies it falls very short. I struggle to understand who is the target reader. Is it Leonardo Di Caprio or is it someone like me? 

The [[10 actions regarding climate change]] they mention in the book are very superficial. The authors mention autonomous cars over and over again. It even feels like they have an ulterior motive. When they discuss about growth, the abandon the topic very quickly, they don't go in depth into any of the things they discuss. And it overall gives this feeling that someone else must do it, while the premise of the book is the opposite, that we should take action. 

The chapter on gender equality is, in my opinion, dangerous. They claim that when there are women in power, the climate agenda gains more visibility and that is the reason to support women in power. This is flawed, because if women would start pushing different agendas it means we should stop supporting them. Gender equality (and equality in general) should be an end in itself and not based on an ulterior motive we want to achieve. 

Many of the topics they discuss feel like they didn't give them enough thought. It feels like the reflection of someone who is thinking about these things for the first time. Sure, fight fake news, go outside of your bubble. Don't own a car, autonomous cars will save us. Artificial Intelligence will make a breakthrough that will save us. 

I think it is a pity that being people with access to world leaders and intellectuals, they stayed only on the surface of the important things. They miss addressing poverty and growth in a responsible way. The levels of consumption and waste of rich countries is orders of magnitude more harmful than in developing countries. 

They propose that we make pools to go to buy vegetables and distribute them in communities in our cities. They say that we should grow our vegetables. They forget that this is something that can happen out of economic need, especially when people have nothing better to do. 

They don't even mention the role of genetically modified crops or nuclear power. A pity, because they are topics that *should* be discussed in any debate regarding climate change. 

Overall, I would say the book is not worth reading.

It is worth mentioning that the book by [[Bill Gates]], [[literature/202311101858 Avoiding a climate disaster|202311101858 Avoiding a climate disaster]], is radically different, more on-point, and actionable.
