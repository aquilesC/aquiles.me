# It's a pity that RSS feeds are fading away
I have been relying on [[rss feed]]s for a very long time. I don't want to check websites periodically just to see if there are new articles. The feeds also made me completely neglect newsletters as ways of keeping up to date. However, there is a patent decline on the implementations of feeds. 

[[GatsbyJS]], for example, does not build feeds out of the box, and many developers neglect them all together. This means that someone has to go through to trouble of understanding how to implement it. 

Feeds are the easiest way of interconnecting websites. They are a transparent way of telling other services about new content. It allows readers to decide when and how to consume content. 

I do believe that feeds are the last bastion of an open and interconnected web. Of course, they are not in the best interests of *some* platforms, but they are in the best interests of *some* readers. Should we just forget about them?
