[[HIV]]-1 viruses are outward budding viruses that recruit cell membrane proteins when forming. This process is very similar to the genesis of some [[EV]]s (particularly small EVs that shed from the plasma membrane). 

This makes it very difficult to use [[biomarkers]] to distinguish a virus-like particle from an EV. In part it is due to [[HIV-1 contains CD9 and CD63]], two classical [[Tetraspanins]] to label EVs, but also because their physical properties are similar[@martinjaular2021]. 

A potential approach to overcome some of the challenges is to perform a [[proteomeic profile of EVs]] and study some of the differences between before/after infection.
