# The problem with people in positions of power in academia
In [[academia]], there is a clear problem with [[gender unbalance]]. The unbalance is a fact, especially true for STEM disciplines, and almost universal. Many researchers acknowledge that it is a problem and that something must be done to correct it. One of the problems is that grants and positions are given based on metrics that favor men. 

Now, when I say *are given*, I actually mean that someone made a decision. There is a person who goes through the CV of the applicant and assigns points or emits a verdict. That person, who in that moment holds a lot of power, is able to correct for the systemic bias. But do they do it? (see [this tweet](https://twitter.com/calippoebbira/status/1309384279735128064?s=20) by [[Andrea Baldi]]). See: [[the hidden power of individual reviewers]]

Researchers in positions of power normally lack the courage to actively decide. They excuse themselves saying 'the rules of the game'. I say fuck the game. You can make a change, just do it! And I believe it is this lack of individual empowerment that is detrimental for the scientific collective. It is the professor reviewing a grant or a tenure application, seated in a comfy chair, probably behind the wall of anonymity, that in the moment in which they can make a difference they claim to work *unbiased*. 

Even if people hide the names of the applicants, they will fall prey of [[the myth of the double blind]], which lacks acknowledging that men and women are not operating in a leveled playing field. 

And people in position of power in academia appear at different stages and with different roles. It may be a reviewer, but it may also be a conference organizer (see: [[women are half the population, not a minority]] and [[limit the number of male speakers in conferences]]). 

A generalized issue, I believe, is that most men in positions of power do not stop to think, reflect, engage in meaningful discussions, nor seek external help. Which is completely in line with the idea that [[if you are the problem, you can't be the solution]].
