> Links are made by readers as well as writers. A stunning thing that we forget, but the link here is not part of the author’s intent, but of the reader’s analysis.

Here the idea of building a [[digital garden]] through an exchangeable set of knowledge 'databases' is at least intriguing. I called them [[backlinks across domains]], but the ideas can go even further, they can relate to [[transclusion]]. I wonder if [[incremental change can lead to undesired outcomes]] also applies in this context.
