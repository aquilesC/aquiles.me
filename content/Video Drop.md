(Scheme from [@boccara2016])

It exploits an [[interferometric detection schemes]] using a non-coherent light source (an LED) that shines straight through the sample. The interference is created by particles in suspension and the light that went close to them. It sounds like a very smart exploit of having a point-spread function larger than the particles themselves. 

According to the website, and some superficial discussion during a conference, the secret lays in the fact that the interference that is measured happens at a very specific plane in the sample (is this related to [[KÃ¶hler Illumination]] in any way?)

In the end, the measurement relies on a [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]], where the largest advantage is that the direct intereference makes it *easier* to acquire, and in principle it detects particles which are weak scatterers. However, it still suffers from all the [[limitations of nanoparticle tracking analysis]].
