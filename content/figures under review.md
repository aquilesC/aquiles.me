# Judging past figures with modern standards
I wonder what is the limit when we judge [[personalities]] from the past with modern standards. I have listened to [[return of oñate foot]], a podcast by [[99% invisible]], in which they explain the role that that particular conquistador has in New Mexico, USA. That person was cruel to the point that it was banished by his own contemporaries. 

I wonder where is the limit when judging personalities with the moral of another time. Is there someone who can survive a thorough scrutiny? One figure that is also under scrutiny is that of [[Columbus]]. Even in [[Argentina]] they removed a statue from behind [[Casa Rosada]]. This had an impact on the Italian community of the country.
