One of the most powerful ideas for building a [[digital garden]], and that is derived directly from [[Luhmann method]], is the atomicity of the notes. The more focus they are, the easier it becomes to link to them from other places. 

This became apparent with the [[Literature Notes]], which I tried at the beginning to keep mixed with the normal notes. After a while it was clear that notes with more than one source in them are too complex, since they would mix different contexts. 

It is also important to keep in mind [[what happens when notes become long]].
