# Chrome will phase out third party cookies

[[Google]] has decided to disable [[third party cookies]] by default on [[Chrome]] in 2022[^1]. First, I am shocked by the fact that they will take two full years to change the default value of a setting. I do believe this is triggered by the fact that such a simple tool, such as a cookie, can outrun Google in their own quest for siphoning user's data.
