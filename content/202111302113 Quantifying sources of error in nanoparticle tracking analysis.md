In order to quantify the sources of errors for [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]], they first distinguish between two methods:

- [[calculating diffusion coefficient from jump statistics]]
- [[Calculating diffusion coefficient from mean squared displacement data]]

They use 550nm polystyrene spheres and track them at 10Hz with 5ms exposure time. Tracks are around 100 frames long. It is important to note that they focus on explaining the difference between the expected average value (i.e. the bulk diffusion coefficient) and not the deviations on each particle measurement. However, many of the things they discuss can be applicable, I believe.
