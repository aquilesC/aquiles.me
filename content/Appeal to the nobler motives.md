If you want to convince a person to act as you want, you may try to find a higher motive to trigger it. Instead of imposing one's will, it is possible to assume there'll be a higher ground on which both agree and from which an undeniable logic in your own favor follow ([@carnegie2010]). 

Instead of appealing to legal grounds when collecting overdue bills one can appeal to a responsibility plane, a moral plane, etc. This is very similar to [[Talk in terms of the other person's interests]], and [[Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves]]. Even though it sounds very good on paper, I wonder how risky this is, since assuming a higher order moral in people will not always exist.
