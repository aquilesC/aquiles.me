They are a kind of [[extracellular vesicles]] with sizes between 30nm and 150nm. They partially overlap in size with [[Microvesicles]], but their biogenesis is different. Exosomes are associated with endocytic pathway and with endosomal multivesicular bodies' formation[@pedrioli2021]. 

There are two *known* pathways for their biogenesis:

- [[ESCRT]]-dependent
    - Are enriched with [[syntenin-1]] and ALG-2-interacting protein X ([[ALIX]])
- [[ESCRT]]-independent
    - Are enriched with tetraspanins ([[CD9]], [[CD63]], [[CD81]], see: [[CD9 and CD63 are used as biomarkers in EVs but they can change from cell line to cell line]])
