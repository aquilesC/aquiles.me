In [@carnegie2010], the author suggests that to make people like us, one of the simplest approaches is to talk about something that interests the other person. He cites an example of a kid who once met a business man who kept talking to him about boats. He didn't have any interest in boats, but the kid did, and he remembers the business man as a polite and interesting person. 

What Carnegie suggests is that we should dedicate time to listening before we start talking about what *we* want. We can dedicate some time talking about the passion of the other person before we bring into attention what we are after (money, selling something, a favor, etc.) The book says that Roosevelt used to research on people's interests before he met them. 

The arguments on this chapter are similar to those on [[Become genuinely interested in other people]], but they go into the realm of making the other person talk. So, on the one hand you have the passive attitude of being interested in others (such as a writer) and on the other you have the exploitation of that interest towards your own advantage.
