[[Founders]] have a critical role in [[Customer Validation]] (they also do in [[Customer Discovery]]), because they are the only ones in a company that have enough understanding and vision to drive the search for a [[business model]]. 

Importantly, [[founders call the shots on pivoting]], and therefore they need to have a complete overview of the process and the current status of the company. 

The challenges with letting anyone else drive customer validation is that they probably have no authority to pivot, and probably they'll have no courage to report negative findings (which are perceived as dealbreakers for the company.)

How would someone transmit poor customer feedback to the founder of the company?
