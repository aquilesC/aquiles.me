	- How they view the problem
	- Impact of the problem (how often)
	- How do they remediate it
- Motivations
	- Existing solutions, what they don't like ([[there is always a solution to the problem]]))
	- Why do they like your solution
- Obstacles
	- What do they like of existing solutions
	- What are the challenges of switching to your solution ([[There is always a cost to introducing new technology]])
