What defines a business? In [[literature/@kaufman2020|@kaufman2020]], there are 5 things that must exist for *something* to be defined as a business:

> 1. Creates and delivers something of value
> 2. That other people want or need
> 3. At a price they are willing to pay
> 4. In a way that satisfies the customers' needs and expectations
> 5. So that the business brings *enough* **Profit** to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operations

I think it is a very reasonable approach to defining what a business is. 

Interestingly, it even works for [[startups]] that survive on investment. They are selling *themselves* (or parts), for a price investors are willing to pay. 

I wonder how this works out in the case of subsidies, when the state gives money but they don't get anything in return (at least not directly).
