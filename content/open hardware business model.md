One of the bottlenecks of [[open hardware]] is to generate a [[business model]] that can generate enough revenue for the project to keep going. Many [[open hardware projects focus on cutting costs]] because they are created in academic settings, in which labor has a virtual zero cost. 

Most business models for open hardware are not different than for traditional hardware:[@pearce2017] 

- [[Specialty parts suppliers for open-hardware tools]]
- [[Calibration services for open-hardware tools]]
- [[Selling open-hardware tools]]
- [[Selling open-hardware services]]
- [[Outsourcing experiments with open hardware tools]]

However, what is important to note is that most models work on the assumption of [[artificially generated scarcity]], or even worse on being cheaper (see: [[open hardware should not be a strategy to overcome licensing]], and [[technology transfer]]). 

A true open-hardware business case can be built if one can prove, for example, [[the value of a community]] built around a tool. However, [[making it open is not enough to build a community]], in the same way that [[being open is not a requirement to build a community]]. Therefore, we must still think if there is a [[specific value in being open hardware]], such as guaranteeing continuity.  

As with software, open-hardware could be a marketing stunt (see: [[why companies fund open source software]]), but the comparison with software misses the point.
