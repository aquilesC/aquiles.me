"[[Sunken Cost]]" is something easy to hear but hard to parse. 

I have recently been in some discussions with people saying: if an investor already invested so much money into a company, they will keep investing until it's successful. 

This is a fallacy that extends beyond [[Venture Capital]] investment in [[startups]]. 

Keep pouring money into something may just lead to higher loses (for instance see [[Net present value]]). 

The fallacy is easy to fall into in daily life, but investors a quite aware of it. That's why they hedge investments, and cover the downsides (for instance, how to liquidate assets to cover the investment, what are the collaterals, etc.)
