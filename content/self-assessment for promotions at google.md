At Google[^1], they were asking people to self-evaluate when they were ready for a promotion and then apply for it. They saw that proportionally more men than women were applying for them. This is related in part to [[expected female traits]], which make women less prone to over reaching. 

However, more interestingly, this is also due to the fact that [[men overestimate their smartness]]. 

At Google, the solution was not to correct the male biased approach, but to force women to act more like men and apply to promotions even if they were not at that stage yet.
