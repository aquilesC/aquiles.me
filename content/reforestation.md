# Reforestation
To my understanding, the best way to remove existing [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere is to plant trees. But, 
- how long does it take for a tree to grow? 
- What are the chances of a tree dying? 
- What happens with the people that need to be displaced in order to have space for planting trees? 

What I can't understand is the real [[carbon cycle]].
