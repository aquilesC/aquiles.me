Sometimes notes become long enough to be closer to an articles in their own right. The idea behind this website is to be a [[digital garden]] in the sense of having access to the notes I take while I learn new things or think about different subjects (very closely related to the idea of [[the Luhmann method]]) but also  from the idea that [[this website is not a blog]]. Therefore, it is inherent to my approach having different types of notes coexisting in the same space. 

These varieties of notes are emerging organically as I start to find patterns between them. Besides the basic note ([[notes should be concept-based]]), I have identified the following taxonomy:

- [[literature notes]]
- [[structure notes]]
- [[ยง notes]]
- [[essays]]
