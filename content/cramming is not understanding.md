The idea of studying before an exam to memorize texts and facts is called **cramming**[^1]. There is, however, a distinction to be made between feeling our brains with short-term memories that are useful to overcome a test, and understanding (see: [[hermeneutic circle]]). Cramming is short-term and whatever knowledge we acquire will probably be lost few days after the test. 

**Understanding**, however, relates to how one links new knowledge to existing one, or how can one switch contexts (see: [[writing down as a mean to understanding what we read]]). 

The extra topic is related to how we access what we learn. [[spaced repetition]] may help boost specific memories, but what about more abstract connections, like the ones needed to build up theories? Ahrens makes the distinction between [[retrieval and storage strength]], and moreover, he claims that [[The Luhmann method]] creates an in-between flash-cards and mental models.
