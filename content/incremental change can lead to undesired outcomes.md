If we think about interfaces such as a keyboard, it is reasonable to assume people would not want radical changes. Getting used to a layout other than the one you already have (be it QWERTY or other) has a big friction. And this is a problem: QWERTY was developed with the type-writer in mind. Computers do not have the same limitations, nor the same goals. Even more, touch screen do not even have keyboards, but they mimic them. 

The need for continuity between one design and the following can push the development of solutions that are far from what is technologically possible, and potentially better, in many aspects. The problem is that [[continuity of design is required by persistent users]]. New users, won't even realize there was a gap. 

Can it be that this incremental change is one of the reasons why [[the web does not resemble the memex]]? 

Also, [[incremental change leads to unsustainable educational paradigms]].
