Extracellular Vesicles (shortened as EV's) are sub-micron sized particles which have an enclosing membrane. They are one mechanism for inter-cellular communication. They are composed of lipids and proteins, and there may be nucleic acid inside (the *cargo*)[@libregts2018].

Extracellular vesicles were initially called nanovesicles, and they belong to one of three different categories based on their biogenesis:[@pedrioli2021, @elsharkasy2020]

- [[Apoptotic Bodies]] (ApoBDs)
- [[Microvesicles]] (MV)
- [[Exosomes]] (EXO)

There is a possibility of [[using exosomes as drug delivery systems]] since they are biocompatible, and already have a similar natural role in multicellular organisms[@pedrioli2021, @elsharkasy2020]. 

Another alternative is [[using EVs as biomarkers]], since it is believed that the regulation of the release and composition of these particles can be correlated to certain diseases. 

The biggest challenge is that most exosomes and microvesicles are <500nm in diameter, and therefore hard to detect by standard means. Moreover, detecting rare particles (perhaps 1% of the particles change between healthy and non healthy humans). Part of these challenges can be addressed by using [[hollow optical fiber]], and is one of the advantages of the [[EVQuant]] method. 

!!! question
	Do other organisms use EV's for [[intracellular communication]]? I assume most [[animals]] do, what about [[plants]]?
