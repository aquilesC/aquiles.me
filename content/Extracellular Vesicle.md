Extracellular Vesicles (shortened as EV's) are sub-micron sized particles which have an enclosing membrane. They are one mechanism for inter-cellular communication. They are composed of lipids and proteins, and there may be nucleic acid inside (the *cargo*)[@libregts2018].

Extracellular vesicles were initially called nanovesicles, and they belong to one of three different categories based on their biogenesis:[@pedrioli2021, @elsharkasy2020]

- [[Apoptotic Bodies]] (ApoBDs)
- [[Microvesicles]] (MV)
- [[Exosomes]] (EXO)

There is potential for using EV's as [[biomarkers]], since it is believed that the regulation of the release and composition of these particles can be correlated to certain [[disease]]. The biggest challenge is that most EV's are <500nm in diameter, and therefore hard to detect by standard means, and that one must be able to detect rare particles (perhaps 1% of the particles change between healthy and non healthy humans). 

!!! question
	Do other organisms use EV's for [[intracellular communication]]? I assume most [[animals]] do, what about [[plants]]?
