Creates theories that map the *[[founders]]*' vision for the product with customers (or markets) that will benefit from them. 

- Do you understand the problems and needs?
- Do you understand *how* to solve the problem? 

If you know, then you can move on to [[Customer Validation]]

It is **very** important to realize that the customer discovery happens **outside** the building. The pitfall of [[Assuming we understand the customer]] is extremely likely. There is no other option but [[talking to customers]] in order to understand what they *need*. This is the step to apply [[jobs theory]], develop the [[customer journey]], and to identify opportunities. 

Also, [[Founders have a fundamental role in customer discovery]], because only they can push forward the process and they have to live it in first-person. 

The trigger for product discovery is the founder's vision (sometimes closely related to the [[product vision]]) and the customer discovery is used to justify the [[market thesis]] (i.e. finding a *market* where to sell the product). 

It is during this stage that the company builds a [[minimum viable prototype]], and a [[minimum viable product]] to show to users and understand if there's a match between features and needs. 

Importantly, the MVP is addressing *the few*, not the many. You should focus on building for those early customers who showed interest, and through them you'll find a way of scaling up to a larger pool of users. 

Some people call this group the [[Crazy quilt around a product]], some call them [[earlyvangelist]]. 

The requirements of the earlyvangelists can be met with a [[minimum viable product]].
