# The Passion Economy
Slowly replacing the gig economy, there is an overall idea that people can live out of whatever "they love doing".

These stories are indicative of a larger trend: call it the “creator stack” or the <a href="https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1169753411639640064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“enterprization of consumer.”</a> Whereas previously, the biggest online labor marketplaces flattened the individuality of workers, new platforms allow anyone to monetize unique skills. Gig work isn’t going anywhere—but there are now more ways to capitalize on creativity. Users can now build audiences at scale and turn their passions into livelihoods, whether that’s playing video games or producing video content. This has huge implications for entrepreneurship and what we’ll think of as a “job” in the future.

Even if there are some remarkable cases of success, they have to be taken very lightly. Most of the examples of the passion economy are built on activities that do not generate wealth and therefore are the first ones to be cut in any economic downturn. However, I don't find people discussing this in length. 

The other aspect is that this "passion economy" is fueled by new forms of content consumption that replaced the attention people was giving, in their free times, to big corporations (such as TV channels). Now, anyone with a camera can put a video online and have millions of watch-hours riddled with advertisements.
