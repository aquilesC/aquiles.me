One of the very first advices I when joining an [[value of incubators|incubator]] was that you should [[love the problem and not the solution]]. You should be passionate about *solving* a problem. 

Although I agree with the core view behind, this approach fails short for people who are coming from a science/academic background.

First, *[[you must love the solution]]*. 

Probably you spent years building something and if you are not in love with it, there is no way to keep pulling through, either as an entrepreneur or as a scientist who keep building on it. 

But the most important aspect is that most university spinouts are [[technologies in search of a problem]] (or to rephrase it, [[solutions in search of a market]]). 

It is extremely hard to know what problem you are going to solve when you are spinning our from the university. Probably, what you thought were problems are self-fabrications. It's extremely hard to know what the reality in an industrial setting is, or what someone from a different field does on a daily basis. 

At some point, it must be acknowledged that at the beginning, the first job of [[scipreneurs]] is to explore the parameter space of their solution. Find as many use cases as possible, and narrow down on the ones that resonate the most.
