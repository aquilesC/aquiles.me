- Notes on [[Working in Public - Nadia Eghbal]]
- [[Simple explanation of an optimization algorithm]]
- [[A new way of blogging]]
- Do you want to learn [[How can a newsletter track you]]?
- Or perhaps you want do discuss about the role of [[Democracy and algorithms]]?
- This is a (partial) list of [[things I've done]]

## Talk to me
If you are interested in open-sourcing your code, or if you are a scientist interested about entrepreneurship, you can [[Talk to Me]]. I am making myself available on Friday afternoon to have 1-on-1 chats. 

### Work in Progress
These are some of the things I am working on [[now]], feel free to comment to expand my knowledge:

- [[Guide on how to open-source projects]] <- This is [[work in progress]]
- [[Designing electronics]] is a joyful (and time consuming) task
- I am thinking about the [[digital garden tos]] (terms of service), help me figure out how to behave in this space!
