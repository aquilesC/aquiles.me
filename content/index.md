## My corner on the Internet

This website can be navigated only by following links. There are no "latest articles", nor algorithmically generated suggestions. Some of these links may be the starting point of exploration into my thinking. 

- I am very interested in understanding [[extracellular vesicle]]s, especially from the perspective of building solutions for researchers within my company [[Dispertech]]. 
- Some people call this website a [[digital garden]], and I have reflected about them, but may need to do it more deeply. 
- Perhaps a list of [[things I've done]] is interesting, or learn [[about me]].

## Talk to me
If you are a scientist interested about entrepreneurship, you can [[Talk to Me]]. I am making myself available on Friday afternoon to have 1-on-1 chats. If you want to chat about [[technolgy transfer]], setting your own company, what it takes and how the road looks like, you are more than welcome to [[contact me]]. 

### Work in Progress
These are some of the things I am working on [[now]], feel free to comment to expand my knowledge:

- I am thinking about [[technology transfer]] and [[entrepreneurship for scientists]]. Perhaps it'll become a book, a workshop?
- I am spending a lot of time trying to understand [[extracellular vesicle]]s and how they can be used to improve the quality of life.
