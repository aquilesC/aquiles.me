## Welcome to my Digital Garden 

This is the place where my notes become public. Some people like calling this type of knowledge building a [[digital garden]]. I went one step further and made it [[Gardening in Public|public]]. 

A small **warning**: 
> Not everything published here are complete thoughts. They are prone to changes, updates, or removals. If you want to engage in a discussion, use the right-hand sided bar that will allow you to address specific paragraphs on the page. 

### No Index
A crucial aspect of this website is that it has [[breaking the chronological order|no chronological index]] as a normal blog would have. Which means the only way to find information is by following links and backlinks. 

For example, you can check some of my interests and check what other notes link into them: 

- [[Entrepreneurship for scientists]]
- [[Open Hardware]]
- [[Digital garden]]

## No Index
This website has no ordered index. The way of navigating it is by following links (and backlinks at the bottom of the page). 

Sometimes checking what I'm working on right [[now]] can be a good starting point. 

Or these are some of the topics that have occupied a lot of my mind in the past and present: 

- [[extracellular vesicles]]: there's plenty of new biology to be discovered, but it'll required a systems-biology type of approach. It's a field full of potential. 
- [[Entrepreneurship for scientists]] which relates very closely to [[technolgy transfer]]. I'm deeply reflecting how to increase the value and impact of research results.
