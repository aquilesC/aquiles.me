## My corner on the Internet

This website is a [[digital garden]]. There are no "latest articles", nor algorithmically generated suggestions. The only way to explore the content is by following links between notes. 

For example, you can follow the links below as triggers to explore this website:

- I am interested in [[entrepreneurship for scientists]]. I am writing a short [[scipreneurs/Playbook/index|Playbook]].
- I was heavily involved in studying [[extracellular vesicles]], mostly because that was the focus on [[Dispertech]], my first [[science-based startups]].
- Perhaps a list of [[things I've done]] is interesting, or learn more [[about me]]. 
- If you are more into software, [[how i built this website]] may serve as inspiration.

## Talk to me
If you are a scientist interested about entrepreneurship, you can [[Talk to Me]]. Just send me some information about your challenges and how do you think I can help you. I am available for 30-minute talks, and we can see how to move forward. 

If you want to chat about [[technolgy transfer]], setting your own company, what it takes and how the road looks like, you are more than welcome to [[contact me]]. 

I am also available as a consultant and mentor for [[science-based startups]]. I can help you with [[business development]], [[product validation]], [[pitching a startup]], or [[business planning]]. 

### Work in Progress
These are some of the things I am working on [[now]], feel free to comment on them to expand my knowledge:

- I am thinking about [[technology transfer]] and [[entrepreneurship for scientists]]. Perhaps it'll become a book, a workshop?
- I am spending a lot of time trying to understand [[extracellular vesicles]] and how they can be used to improve the quality of life.
