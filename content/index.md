# These are my Open Notes
This website is the public face of the notes I take while reading, thinking, and writing. It means this notes are written for me, not you. There's a chance some will be confusing, incomplete, or maybe incorrect. But it's part of experimenting online and seeing what happens.

Overall, you'll find three types of notes:

- [[Literature Notes]], like the ones I am taking on [[literature/@mazzucato2018|The Entrepreneurial State by Mazzucato]] 
- Notes as part of my [[taking notes for knowledge creation|knowledge creation]] strategy, such as when I think about [[Product Management]]. 
- Finally, sometimes I make a longer dive and it [[What happens when notes become long|becomes an essay]], like [[essays/My Story as a Founder|My Story as a Founder]]. 

Many like calling this type of websites a [[digital garden]]. This is my attempt at [[better thinking]], while [[learning in public]]. 

## Essays 
Some of the essays I've written lately:

- [[essays/Do things that can scale|Do things that can scale]]
- [[essays/My Story as a Founder|My Story as a Founder]]
- [[essays/How it feels quitting your own startup|How it feels quitting your own startup]]

## No Index
This website has no ordered index. The way of navigating it is by following links (and backlinks at the bottom of the page). 

Sometimes checking what I'm working on right [[now]] can be a good starting point. 

Or these are some of the topics that have occupied a lot of my mind in the past and present: 

- [[extracellular vesicles]]: there's plenty of new biology to be discovered, but it'll required a systems-biology type of approach. It's a field full of potential. 
- [[Entrepreneruship for scientists]] which relates very closely to [[technolgy transfer]]. I'm deeply reflecting how to increase the value and impact of research results.
