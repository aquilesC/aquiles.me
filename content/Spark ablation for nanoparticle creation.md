The technique commercialized by [[VSParticle]] is called "Spark Ablation", because it brings together two electrodes of a given material and through a spark in between them, nanoparticles can be created. 

Some of the advantages include that the particles are created in an inert gas atmosphere at normal pressures. After the spark, nanoparticles can be printed onto substrates (for example, directly to microfluidic chips) or can be transported further and deposited onto other surfaces.
