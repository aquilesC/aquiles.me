After we have completed the [[Customer Discovery]] and [[Customer Validation]] phases, we should be confident we can *scale* the operation. Scaling in this sense means that we understood where our customers are and how to reach them. 

We know that if we spend €1 in marketing, we get €2 in sales. And we can keep repeating the process. 

Build end-user demand and scale selling

- Attacking an existing market (customers are well defined, but there are also competitors)
- Defining a new market (you don't know who the customer is yet, but there are no competitors either) (sometimes referred as [[Blue Ocean strategy]], but remember that [[Blue Ocean strategy gives little insight]])
- Re-segmenting a market based on cost or niche
