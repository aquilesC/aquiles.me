People exposed to the [[entrepreneurship]] world, and especially those who seek [[venture capitalists]] to help them achieve the goals, are always exposed to the idea of *exponential growth*, the infamous hockey-stick projection. 

Especially [[deep tech]] enterprises are not prone to those growth rates, but VC need few exponentially fast companies to justify the losses incurred in the other projects. 

[[Bootstrapping a company]], for example, is probable a path that will not lead to exponential growth, but to [[organic growth]]. It will be a matter of aligning the expectations of the entrepreneur with the possibilities available around them. 

And although the growth may not be exponential, [[all companies must grow]]. A company that does not grow, is lagging behind inflation, and especially behind in opportunity costs.
