In [[Python]], when using the [[ThreadPoolExecutor]] of concurrent.futures, it is hard to know how many elements are waiting in the queue to be processed. The best I could gather is [^1] :

```python
executor._work_queue
```
That is the queue where the ``WorkItems`` are stored. 

- Can it be a good idea to create my own ``PoolExecutor``?
