I had several issues trying to create a bootable Windows 10 and Windows 11 USB from a Mac computer. 

The most frustrating error I was getting during installation was: 

> Windows could not prepare the computer to boot into the next phase of installation

It all came down to a poorly formatted USB bootable disk. I couldn't find much information (definitely nothin on the Microsoft Website). 

The only thing that made it work was using Windisk Writer, a free app that can be downloaded from Github:
