# Talk to Me
I am making myself available on Fridays afternoons (CET) to have a one-on-one chat if:

- You are a scientist (Ph.D., Postdoc, Prof.) curious about **entrepreneurship**
- You want to discuss about **open-source software**, how-to, why, when. 
- Want to discuss about the **career choices** for scientists, either before starting a Ph.D., or if you are considering moving out of academia
 
If you identify yourself with one of the above, use the form (or [this link](https://calendly.com/aquiles-pftl/30min)) to schedule a meeting with me. If you don't identify with one of the topics but still want to reach out, see how to [[contact me]].
