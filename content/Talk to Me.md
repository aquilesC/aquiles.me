# Talk to Me
I am making myself available on Fridays afternoons (CET) to have a one-on-one chat if:

- You are a scientist (Ph.D., Postdoc, Prof.) curious about entrepreneurship
- You want to discuss about open-source software, how-to, why, when.

If you identify yourself with one of the above, use the form (or [this link](https://calendly.com/aqui-carattino)) to schedule a meeting with me.
