I had this initiative of opening my availability on Friday's afternoons to talk to people about a series of topics. Sadly, the impact I was hoping for didn't materialize, so I discontinued them. 

The best is to see how to [[contact me]] and reach out through a traditional channel. I'm always checking them.
