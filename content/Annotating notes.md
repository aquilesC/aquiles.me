epistemic: This is a new experiment on creating annotation on notes. I'll review the results during 2025 to understand the impact it had (if any)

When I started this [[digital garden]], I thought about the implications of adding [[essays/comments on digital gardens|comments on digital gardens]]. [[Webmentions]] seemed like a useful way to proceed, but their implementation is a bit cumbersome (for example, receiving a webmention is trivial, while sending one is not.) 

Annotating notes through [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is) seems like an efficient way of lowering the barrier for others to drop quick notes on my own notes. It can even work when I'm browsing through them and need to leave a quick reminder. 

I haven't used much hypothesis because it lacks good support on Firefox, and because it keeps expanding my digital footprint. I like the idea of connecting the knowledge I generate in a single place. 

I try to annotate through [[Zotero]], because it increases the chances of discovery and interlinking, but I may try again Hypothesis, especially because the number of web content I started consuming increased a lot, compared to old-style paper formats. 

Tag: #TODO Review the results of adding annotations. Proposed date: 01/05/2025
