One of the effects of the pandemic is that it became evident how much unpaid work is being done by women. Normally it takes the shape of domestic duties, or caring for children, and elders. The difference became patent when the productivity of women started to decline[^1]. This phenomenon also appears in highly educated parts of society, such as with researchers. [[Women scientists are publishing less during the pandemic]].[^2]


[[Open Question]]: Is there a way of quantifying in monetary terms how much are unpaid women contributing to family or national economies?
