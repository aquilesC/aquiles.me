The amount of [[CD9]] and [[CD63]] (tetraspanins) could change from cell line to cell line[@hartjes2020]. [[TR-FIA]] is a bulk measurement that does not allow to distinguish sub-populations, therefore single-particle measurements are an advantage. This is what [[quantifying the concentration of EVs in urine or plasma through confocal microscopy]] allows at a single-particle level. 

> More [[epitope]]s on the surface of an EV will increase the TR-FIA signal, but more epitopes at a single-particle level will not result in higher EV count.
> - [@hartjes2020]

**Importantly**, although [[CD9]] and [[CD63]] are often used as general EV markers, they are only detected on a fraction of EV's. 

Thorough analysis of the relative abundance of CD9, CD63, and CD81 in different populations of EV's show the very high variation[@kugeratski2021]
