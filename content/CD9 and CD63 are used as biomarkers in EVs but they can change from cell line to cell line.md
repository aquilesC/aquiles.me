The amount of [[CD9]] and [[CD63]] (tetraspanin) could change from cell line to cell line[@hartjes2020]. [[TR-FIA]] is a bulk measurement that does not allow to distinguish subpopulations, therefore single-particle measurements are an advantage. This is what [[quantifying the concentration of EVs in urine or plasma through confocal microscopy]] allows at a single-particle level. 

> More [[epitope]]s on the surface of an EV will increase the TR-FIA signal, but more epitopes at a single-particle level will not result in higher EV count.

**Importantly**, although [[CD9]] and [[CD63]] are often used as general EV markers, they are only detected on a fraction of EV's.
