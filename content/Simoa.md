Simoa stands for **single-molecule arrays**[@rissin2010] and essentially consists of an essay to detect very small concentrations of antigens, following protocols very similar to those of the [[Elisa tests]]. 

The general principle is like in the image below:

Paramagnetic beads, coated with a known antibody can diffuse in the medium, capturing antigens. The process is the same as in the Sandwich ELISA (see: [[Elisa tests]]). They are later precipitated onto specific arrays in which only one bead fits. 

By looking at each well with and without the beads and with or without fluorescence, it is possible to conduct a **digital elisa test**. 

The method can detect as little as $$10^{-19}M$$ under special conditions, or $$10^{-15}M = 10fM$$ in clinical conditions.
