The correlation between extinction of fauna and the arrival of humans to North-America could be seen as the evidence of a causal link[@martin1966]. 

The [[Pleistocene extinctions]] are temporally correlated to the arrival of modern humans, and there is evidence of extinctions in Africa during the same time-period. 

However, [[not all hominins drove extinctions in islands]], which cast some doubts regarding the validity of the overkill extinction across the board. One possibility is that *overkill* is a result of cultural changes that appeared later in time and not an intrinsic characteristic of humans.
