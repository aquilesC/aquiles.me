[[Tetraspanins]] such as [[CD9]], [[CD63]], [[CD81]] are standard for identifying [[extracelluar vesicle]]s. However, an important question to be asked is whether the amounts of these proteins is homogeneous across a distribution of [[EV]]'s or across different populations. Some preliminary work [@mizenko2021] shows that the number of tetraspanins can change. The image below are results using the [[ExoView]] instrument.

Essentially it is possible to see the cross-correlation between different proteins and their change over time (figure b). I don't really understand, for example, how can it be that if the capture antibody is CD9, it shows such a low signal when the detection antibody is also CD9. I wonder if this is a matter of efficiency, or that CD9 is a single-protein in most EV's (and thus can't be double bounded). 

I wonder if it is possible to use [[syntenin-1]] as a marker after the [[EV]]s have been immobilized on a substrate. For example by doing a two step measurement, first of the membrane proteins and then of the intraluminal proteins.
