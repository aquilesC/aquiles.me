Is the name of the product from [[NanoView Biosciences]] that implements the [[SP-IRIS]] method. The image below [@mizenko2021] shows an example of how the device can be used.

The interesting thing is that it implements interferometric detection (very similar to [[iSCAT]]) and fluorescence detection. Therefore it allows to quantify both labeled and unlabeled objects. Particularly, the chips used seem to be able to contain different antibodies, and therefore they allow to perform single-particle [[Elisa test]] using different proteins in one go. 

According to [@mizenko2021], the detection limit for the scattering method is $50\,nm$ for EV's given some phenomenological constrains, but in theory the method (iSCAT) can be pushed for single-molecule detection. 

This is a clear example of how easy it is for a company, like [[Refeyn]], to [[Miss out opportunities because of internal culture]].
