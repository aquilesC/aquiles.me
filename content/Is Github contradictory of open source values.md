# Is Github contradictory of open source values? 

When developing [[Open source]], one of the core values used to be the independence from the tools used, especially when those tools are proprietary. An example can be the use of ``gcc`` instead of an Intel compiler. 

However, the convenience of easy-to-use tools such as Github outweights the political reasons behind open source[@eghbal2020]. That is why so many projects, including some very big, such as Python, moved to Github. 

The question that remains is, therefore, what are the [[open source values]]? Do they change over time? 

Another interesting point is that Github does not take community suggestions. Developers had to create a repository within Github to complain and to suggest improvements. Is the governance of Github aligned with the interests of their users?
