# Development costs of open source software
Developing code takes time, and therefore its costs can always be measured, at least, as [[opportunity cost]]. Without focusing on code ([[open source]] or not) financed by companies, the costs of development are normally absorbed by individuals. It may start as a simple plugin for a larger platform, a cool command line tool. This is a short snippet from cURL history (released for the first time in 1997):

Today, I am employed by my forth company during curl’s life time: <strong>Mozilla</strong>. All through this project’s lifetime, I’ve kept my work situation separate and I believe I haven’t allowed it to disturb our project too much. Mozilla is however the first one that actually allows me to spend a part of my time on curl and still get paid for it!

However, developing open-source code can have an intrinsic value for the creator(s) since it becomes a way of making a name for themselves. In the same way that you can [[grow your online persona with smart performative blogging]], you can achieve something similar through releasing code, whatever you feel more comfortable doing, sometimes even both. 

I also believe there is another possibility, which relates to the joy of contributing. If I can make a tool perform better, or provide some **value** to a group of people, then why not just go ahead and do it. The biggest difference with other products, is that software has a virtually zero [[marginal cost]] for the developer, which makes it easy to scale. On the other hand, [[Maintenance costs of open source projects]] are often undervalued. 

To think: 

- Why [[open source is associated with free]]? 
- Are there examples of [[Free but not open source software]] that actually built a community?
