According to [[Gallup]], there are 12 things that impact the most the performance of employees in their workplace. In other words, there are 12 dimensions that [[managers]] need to keep on the lookout to ensure that the team performs at its best:

1. I know what is expected of me at work
2. I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right
3. At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day
4. In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work
5. My supervisor, or someone at work, seems to care about me as a person
6. There is someone at work who encourages my development
7. At work, my opinions seem to count
8. The mission or purpose of my company makes me feel my job is important
9. My associates or fellow employees are committed to doing quality work
10. I have a best friend at work
11. In the last six months, someone at work has talked to me about my progress
12. This last year, I have had opportunities at work to learn and grow. 

The first two questions are important in a new role, and what needs to be clarified by a manager. 

Then, from Q3 to Q6 it's a matter of *giving*, and knowing that others value your contributions. 

Q7~Q10 are centered on *belonging* to the place. Do people value the same things you value, you are working on the same things. 

Q11~Q12 is about collectively growing. Everyone is doing the best and become the best versions of themselves. 

Interestingly, Q10 closely relates to the discussion about [[loneliness at work]] that is permeating different companies and cultures. 

**Managers** focus on Q1 to Q6, which are the ones they can control. Keeping in mind, of course, that the purpose is to have top ratings at many of them, and not to create an unbalanced situation.
