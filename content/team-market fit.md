Startups often struggle to achieve [[product-market fit]]. Or, at least, that's in the playbook of most entrepreneurs. 

However, most playbooks also include things in the lines of *a team is the most important asset*[@kin]. Therefore, a crucial aspect to evaluate is whether the team is the appropriate one for the specific market in which it is operating. 

For example, a group of physicists, designers, and software developers, can build a fantastically looking and performant tool. However, what are the chances they can market it to physicians in a hospital? 

This goes beyond the [[value proposition-market fit]]. It's not a focus change that will make the product a success, it'll be a deeper organisational modification.
