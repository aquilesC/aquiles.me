The argument that education is a path of upwards social mobility is, in my opinion, a bit controversial. The biggest challenge is the definition first, of [[social mobility]], and then of a context that allows for the entire society to move upwards and not just a small fraction while the rest is convected down as in a close system. The fact that [[science education outputs correlate with socioeconomic level]] is pointing towards this direction. 

On of the possibilities is that education enables upwards mobility globally through the progress it will generate during many decades. If [[correlating GDP to scientific productivity is a reasonable proxy for progress]], one must ask how to increase scientific productivity, and that is one of the key aspects, I believe of [[why we teach science in school]], to broaden the base of interested people and proposed solutions.
