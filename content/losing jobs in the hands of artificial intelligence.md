# Losing Jobs in the Hands of Artificial Intelligence
The release of [[gpt-3]] and its public [[API]] generated a lot of discussion (again) about losing jobs in the hands of [[artificial intelligence]][^1]. Sadly, most discussions are given without a lot of thought and without a lot of understanding of what is going on. I even read a book by a specialized *journalist* ([Machines Can't Dream](https://inteligencia.com.ar/)) in which the word statistics is mentioned not even once. 

Automatization is a process that has been taking place since several centuries. We have windmills to grind grains instead of doing it manually. Factories have tools that increasingly require less human intervention. Cleaning the streets in places where salaries are too high is done with machines instead of by an army of employees. 

I guess in every step of progress people was afraid of losing jobs. However, the wealthier part of society was never at risk. A lawyer could not be replaced, an architect neither. But is it so? AutoCAD made architects more efficient. Doesn't this mean, by definition, that we can leave with fewer architects? 

People is paying a lot of attention to [[self-driving cars]], forgetting that public transport has been around for quite a while and achieves a similar goal: going from one place to the other without driving. There is a surge on something called [[no-code]] tools that allow anyone to make websites without programming. 

All this is happening without any artificial intelligence intervention, just by creating better and more versatile tools. 

Therefore, I do believe that [[artificial intelligence]] is one more step in this process of automatizing. 

## Is the Fear of AI Justified?
I don't think *fear* is the right word regarding technologies that can transform the world. I do think, however, that we must re-think how we live. People through the world is getting more and more productive. We can make in minutes what before took hours. Access to goods is being democratized. However, we still work 40 hours a week. 

I think the *fear* of [[AI]] is playing an important role for questioning what kind of world we want to live in. We can't keep with increasing production forever, the world is finite and the environment is suffering. What will happen once we can produce things in a fully automated way, without having to exploit workers in Southeast Asia to make cheap clothes? 

*Some* new jobs will be created, but what can really AI do is increase the productivity of a lot of sectors that now are bound to the limits of human time availability. Imagine if there would be an AI doctor or radiologist. Consults could be much faster and much more accessible without increasing the current number of physicians. 

## How can the future be?
The biggest challenge is that the capitalistic world is not prepared for a qualitative jump. People has started discussing about [[universal basic income]] to compensate for the lack of access to work. Imagine a world where very few people *had* to work, what would the rest do? If we all worked only 2 hours a week, what would we do with the extra time? 

Somehow we were made to believe we *have* to work. If you pay attention, you will find rich people taking sabbaticals of 1 or 2 years. Millenials traveling the world. Of course, if you are the child of a factory worker in Myanmar chances are you will never be able to even dream about such a lifestyle. But, would it be too extreme to think that future that awaits us is a communist future?
