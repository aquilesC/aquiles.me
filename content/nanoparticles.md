# Nanoparticles

Objects that have all dimensions below 1um are considered nanoparticles. I say all dimensions, because it is possible to have [[fibers]] which are very thin but long. Their volume could be equivalent to that of a nano-sphere, but one of their dimensions can be much above one micron. 

## Examples of nanoparticles
- Man made nanoparticles can be of different materials. Notably [[gold nanoparticles]] can be found in [[tainted glass]]. The oldest example I know is the [[Lycurgus Cup]]. Also other [[metal nanoparticles]] are used for [[sunscreen]] since they can be made to absorb UV light.  
- Natural nanoparticles can be [[extracellular vesicles]] and [[Virus]].
