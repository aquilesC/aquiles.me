Ahrens[^1] describes the exposure effect as the scenario when people think they are better at a task simply because they have done it several times. This describes why, for example, [[Multitasking does not increase productivity]] although multi-taskers believe they are good at it. 

How does [[spaced repetition]] fit in this context? The only way of justification is if there is a feedback loop that allows the practitioner to understand whether there was an improvement compared to the previous iteration. This means that there should be an absolute frame of reference to which one can compare.
