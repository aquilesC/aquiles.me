The e-mails I send are normally signed. To verify the validity of the signature, you can download my public key:

## Cases in which my e-mails are not signed
The only legitimate case in which I do not sign my e-mails is if I send them from a mobile device. 

**If you receive an unsigned e-mail** act on the presumption that can't be trusted. If you think it may be the work of an impersonator, please contact me as soon as possible. If you believe my e-mails is compromised, you can find alternative ways of reaching out: [[contact me]].
