# Newsletter
I decided not to have a newsletter for this web space. At least not for now, and probably not for ever. You can [[contact me]] and let me know your thoughts about this. 

## Why I thought about a newsletter
I started considering the idea of building a newsletter because I saw everybody else doing it. After careful consideration, I realized I don't want to have a newsletter. Most of the things I would share by e-mail I already share on the RSS feed of this website, or through Twitter. 

In the end, do I care about meeting my audience or letting my audience meet me? I don't want to curate content for others, and I don't want to rely on e-mail for others to know about what I think. This website is exactly for that, and it even has an [[rss feed]], in case someone wants to get notified of every single change.
