When using [[brownian motion]] to characterize particles, it is important to always take a look at the [[Sources of error in measuring Brownian Motion]]. Especially for [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] (or [[NTA]]), the accuracy of the method is related to the track length that can be recorded. 

Longer tracks allow to calculate the MSD with higher precision, and thus the fitting process is more accurate. However, longer tracks can suffer from long-term stability issues. This leads to the other side of the problem, which is estimating the [[optimal number of fitting points for MSD measurements]].
