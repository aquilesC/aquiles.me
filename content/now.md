# NOW!
- I have moved to Paris at the end of September, and I am currently exploring opportunities
- I am helping [[science-based startups]] with different problems they encounter, such as [[business development]], or [[pitching a startup]]. 
- I am studying about [[corrosion]], because it seems like a field with interesting opportunities
- I have redeveloped [[Python for the Lab]], and I am thinking what content to add to it and how to restructure the articles to make them easier to parse.
