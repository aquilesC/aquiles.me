# NOW!
- I'm going through a [[Six Sigma]] course on EdX. 
- I'm following a [[quantum optics]] course on Coursera. 
- Working on a [[scipreneurs/Playbook/index|Playbook]] for Scipreneurs. 
- Re-writing [[Python for the Lab]]. The biggest change I'm introducing is the idea of an alternative to the [[model view controller]] pattern, temporary title the [[device experiment view]].
- I am consulting [[Envue]] on a range of topics, including pitch deck, business development, and product development. 
- I am slowly catching up with [[free flow electrophoresis]]. I have some ideas I want to understand how can be useful in different settings.
