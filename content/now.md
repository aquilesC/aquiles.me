# NOW!
- I'm looking into [[Product Management]] roles. 
- I'm working on the [[scipreneurs]] website
- Re-writing [[Python for the Lab]]. The biggest change I'm introducing is the idea of an alternative to the [[model view controller]] pattern, temporary title the [[device experiment view]] (which has a lame acronym: DEV).
- I'm looking into the idea of a [[Startup Studio]] for [[deep tech]].
