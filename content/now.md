# NOW!
- Going through an interesting process: [[essays/how it feels quitting your own startup]]
- Starting to focus on my next challenges. Deciding whether:
    - Finding a job in a larger organization is the way to exert the changes I want to generate
    - Supporting startups, either locally or those which want to expand into Europe
    - Focus on my own projects once more. Perhaps press [[Python for the Lab]] forward to gain some runway, and leverage that to setup some [[open hardware]] projects in motion
- Dusting off my pitch-deck design skills
