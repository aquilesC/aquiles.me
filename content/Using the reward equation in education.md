I recall seeing a project in which through gamification, students with attention problems could stay focused for longer. If you are solving maths problems, for example, and once in a while you collect a coin (Ã -la Mario Bros.) that periodic influx of dopamine can get you hooked into solving math problems. 

Therefore, I wonder whether the [[reward equation]], which is structurally similar to what [[spaced repetition]] proposes, can be used directly in education. 

What are the goals of education? Habit forming? Transmission of standard knowledge? 

Moreover, social networks should have a massive understanding of this problem (see: [[social networks exploit the reward equation]]). Couldn't that information be extrapolated to other areas? (Extrapolated or directly applied).
