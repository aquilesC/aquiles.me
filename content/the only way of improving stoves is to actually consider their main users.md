Traditional stoves are a health problem for many women and small children in under-developed countries. There have been many attempts at improving the conditions be re-designing the stoves in order for them to burn fuel better, or simply using other combustion mechanisms. However, many of these solutions were done without actually understanding their customers [@criadoperez2020]. The biggest problem was that the designers made some assumptions probably from a male-perspective, and therefore even if they could have been healthier for women, they were not improving their lives. They could take longer to cook a meal, could require wood to be cut in a different way, could require more maintenance.
