# Why would you learn how to open source projects?

## Who
- A PI who does not actually code/build: 
    - to understand how to empower the careers of the people they mentor
- A Ph.D./Postdoc: 
    - To create a name by themselves
- General:
    - To try to solve problems in reproducibility
    - To simplify the process of building on each other knowledge
    - Because it is a requirement from funding agencies
    - Just because, why not?
    - A political statement? ([[Open source is a political act]])
- A manager in a company:
    - To create a following, AKA: traction
    - To lower the maintainability burden: people can solve their own problems
    - To avoid paying license fees
- An employee in a company:
    - To build a persona that transcends the company
    - To give back to a community
    - To have a clear product to market to a next employment? <- This is *fundamental* for Ph.D.s and Postdocs, especially if they move out of academia
    - To be able to pitch to managers the idea of open-sourcing
- People working in [[Open Hardware]]
    - What are their objectives? <- #TODO, try to understand the community
