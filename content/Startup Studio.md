The idea of Studio is that it's an organization that acts as co-founders for [[startups]]. They have resources to streamline the creation of the early products, they know how to validate ideas, and have a network to achieve speed faster than what a single founder could. 

[[Nascent Ventures]], for example, could have been a studio, but they created companies from the onset and didn't share any kind of resources. 

Once ideas have been tested and validated, the studio creates a startup as an independent organization. The business model for studios can be associated with keeping equity on future companies (carry), as well as charging management fees for the services provided. 

## Advantage of studios
I believe the largest advantage is the compounding effect. If ideas don't pan out, the knowledge can stay in-house instead of lost as what happens when startups close. 

The knowledge also accumulates over time, for example the network of early adopters, access to funding, and related skills that a single entrepreneur may lack (especially if it's their first experience).
