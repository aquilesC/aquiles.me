To determine the degree of scientific literacy of an individual, we must established the scope (see: [[why we teach science in school]]). This is directly linked to how the [[PISA tests]] try to evaluate students. 

There are different stages (see perhaps: [[lifecycle of a sicentific idea]]) and skills (competences) that must be developed:[@minzi2018]

- Experimenting
- Hypothesis generation
- Evidence evaluation
- Inference

But, they can be further extended to a more concrete plane:

- Predictions/Hypothesis
- Variable correlations
- Experiment design
- Observation/Measurement
- Classification/serialization
- Investigative techniques
- Transformation
- Interpretation

These different skills fit perfectly the ideas if [[Curiosity-driven education]], by [[science education should be method-oriented]]. 

Although the different steps seem reasonable, I am completely missing the trigger. How can we experiment if we don't have a question. This is one of the biggest concerns I have: [[ideas are born through interaction with the world]]. 

The competences are measured through [[standardized educational tests]]. Through this tests it is possible to know that, at least in Latin America, [[science education outputs correlate with socioeconomic level]] and that [[university students perform poorly in basic science tests]].
