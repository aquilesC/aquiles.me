# Self-Host My Newsletter

I tried for a while to use [[Substack]] because they were a modern, user-friendly way of having a newsletter. However, as soon as I realized [[Substack wants to scoop as much information as they can]] I stopped using them and cancel my account. I went back to self-hosting [my newsletter](self-host my newsletter). It is a hassle and it requires a lot of time and effort to keep it running, but is the only way I could find to guarantee that the privacy of my readers was respected.
