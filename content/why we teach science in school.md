We all probably know that being able to add and subtract is important. To calculate taxes, to be sure the bill of the supermarket makes sense. Learning how to calculate the area of a rectangle is important when we are about to buy or rent a house. But, honestly, how much more math do we *use* on our daily lives? 

One widespread opinion is that [[science education is utilitaristic]]



People may discuss that [[replacing analysis with statistics]] is important for the future, but they lack the basic agreement on what to expect from education. Should schools give the tools for people to work? Then we risk having systems that quickly are outdated. We don't know what would be relevant in 20 or 50 years from now.
