The [[Product Requirements Document]] has to be very well defined and validated as much as possible for this type of development. An alternative is [[agile development]]. 

- It is very structured
- Defined stages
	- You only move from one stage to the next once the previous is completed
- Detailed specifications
- All requirements are fully laid out
- Budgeting is accurate
- Less day-to-day management
**But**
- Maybe you don't fully know the requirements
- It is difficult to make changes
- Unknowns may impact timelines
- Market conditions change during development
