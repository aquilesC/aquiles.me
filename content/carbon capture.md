One possible solution to our current emission rates is not to avoid them, but to offset them by taking carbon out of the atmosphere. For instance, planting a tree would capture $CO_2$ and store it in itself and the ground. 

The biggest challenge is that there are no carbon capture technologies available that can sequester enough gas. The density of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere is relatively low, meaning the technologies would need a gigantic footprint. 

This is slightly different for capturing at the source. For example, while making cement or steel (see: [[literature/202311101921 The biggest problem is making Things|202311101921 The biggest problem is making Things]]). A carbon capture system could be installed directly at the exhaust of chimneys.
