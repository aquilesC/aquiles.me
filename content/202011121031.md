Regulatory bodies have a great responsibility in the generation of the [[gender data gap]]. Car manufacturers, for example, are not required to test the safety using female dummies (@criadoperez2020, chapter 9). This means that seat belts, airbags, position of pedals, etc. are designed based on the average male (see: [[male by default]]). The data regarding the risk of women in cars points to a problem that almost no one is addressing. 

Also, when they added female dummies to the tests, the safety ratings of many cars dropped considerably (see: [[building to pass tests]]). Female dummies are either anatomically not correct (i.e. is only a smaller male dummy), or are used only on passenger seats.
