# Bikepacking

The idea of doing a trip on a bicycle, carrying your own luggage. Like [[backpacking]], but on wheels. 

- Advantages over backpacking: You don't rely on external means of transportation. Especially during [[Covid19]] times, this is an advantage. Also, it is a good **exercise**. 
- Disadvantages over backpacking: The distances covered are much smaller. Traveling 80km in a day is a relatively good distance. This limits the choice of destinations
- Advantages over traveling by car: Since you move slower, you get the chance to experience landscapes, villages, and situations in a more relaxed and deep way. Much lower [[carbon footprint]].
- Disadvantages over traveling by car: Makes it harder to plan. Bike paths are not universal, sharing space with cars can be daunting. Distances make *small* detours not possible (i.e. a 30km detour is a 20 minute drive or a 2 hour ride).
