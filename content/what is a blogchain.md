# What Is a Blogchain?
Imagine what would happen if, instead of writing 10k words for an article, you could split it up into smaller containers. Each one with a clear scope. This is not too different from how I started planning my [[video tutorials]]: short, stackable pieces of content that can allow the reader to traverse the information in the path they desire.

A blogchain is longform by other means. Containerized longform if you like. A themed blog-within-a-blog, built as a series of short, ideally fixed-length posts (we’re trying to standardize on 300 words as one container size).

Thinking in blogchains may both help to [[lower the barrier to writing]], and develop into [[a new way of blogging]]. However, the examples I've seen up to now, such as [Tom Critchlow's](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/) seem more in the direction of grouping together posts based on a theme than building a long form article based on containers.
