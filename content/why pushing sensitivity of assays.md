Normal assays for biomolecules have detection thresholds of around $pM$. However, a tumor of $1mm^3$ contains around 1 million cells. Each secrete around 5000 proteins, and the human body has around 5 liters of blood. This gives around: 

$$10^6 \frac{\textrm{prot}}{ml}$$, or 

$$2\cdot10^{-15}\textrm{M}$$
