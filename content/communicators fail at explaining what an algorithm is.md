# Communicators fail at explaining what an algorithm is
The world moves fast, and communicators are failing at doing their jobs. We entered a time when a lot of people is talking about [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]], but few even understand what an [[algorithm]] is. I even found a book about [[machine learning]] (in Spanish: "[[Las máquinas no pueden soñar]]") written by someone who defines himself as *an expert* in which the word *statistics* is not mentioned only once. 

If a journalist can manage to get funding to write a book with that kind of content, where are we going? 

Communicators are transmitting information from a highly biased position without ever acknowledging it. I don't even know whether they acknowledge it at least privately.
