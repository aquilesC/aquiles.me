This company is a spinout from Cambridge and is trying to commercialize the results from [[@merryweather2021]], and [[@merryweather2022]]. 

They completely stole the tag line from [[Refeyn]], and as far as I can tell from the papers, they have nothing to sell except [[iSCAT]] instruments. 

It is possible that they have a deal with Refeyn to re-brand instruments in a new field. The exit strategy is clear (being absorbed by Refeyn), and for Refeyn it becomes a clearer path for an exit, since they'll have a long-craving achivement: two business units.
