When performing [[experiments for idea validation]], the only way of preventing [[post hoc ergo propter hoc]] fallacies is to set the threshold that defines success beforehand (not too different from OKRs: [[literature/202112050837 Definition of OKRs]].)

However, it is hard to establish a clear value that is not overly arbitrary. For example, we can ask a pool of people whether they would use our product. Does it matter if 10% answer yes? What if it would be 73%? As long as it is more than 0% then it is an indication we would have customers. 

Of course, if the product relies on some network effect, below 50% may be too low. But for standard products, what is a common adoption rate? How many of us use Google Drive as opposed to Nextcloud ([[Installing and running Nextcloud on Raspberry Pi]])? However, a smaller adoption rate does not make it an unfeasible business case.
