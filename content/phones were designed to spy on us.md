The design of the [[operating system]] of phones, regardless of whether it is an [[Android]] or [[iPhone]] is to spy on their users. Phones give a lot of information to [[apps]], regardless of their purpose. Moreover, they allow them to run at periodic intervals, collecting anything from GPS position to battery status. 

The fact that anyone can think of a million ways how Google or Apple spy on us, means that there are at least 10 million ways we didn't think of. Plus, the many ways they empower other companies to prey on users' [[data]] and [[information]]. 

Is there a real way to protect my [[privacy]] without resorting to living off-grid? Why is it so complicated?
