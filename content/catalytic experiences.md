Assuming that [[the traditional marketing funnel]] is no longer a valid model to drive sales, [@ghanadan2016] proposes a different approach, in which [[social media for scientific marketing]] has a predominant role. With this in mind, he also argues that customers must experience brands in a completely different way. In principle, the marketeer can guide the approach through: 

- Thought leadership
- Catalytic experience
- Humanization

In all cases, the idea is that brands should be closer to customers. A company's profile is almost at the same level than a person's profile on social networks. Feeds are mingled, and therefore having an honest display of the company's intentions is always a great benefit. 

Specifically, a catalytic experience can be achieved through a combination of materials, written, audio, video, that drive a customer towards making the decisions the marketeer was expecting.
