# Lowering the Maintenance burden of open source projects
Assuming that attention from a producer is a non-excludable, rivalrous good[^1], projects must implement methods to optimize the use of the available attention. Some possibilities are:[@eghbal2020]

- Automation: Continuous Integration, Bots
- Clear guidelines: Templates, code style, linters
- Limiting available attention (for example not accepting pull-requests)
- Distributing costs: creating user-supported forums (see: [[The interaction between Stackoverflow and Github]])
- Increase available attention: see [[the role of money in open source]]
