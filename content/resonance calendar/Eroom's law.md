> **Eroom's law** is the observation that drug discovery is becoming slower and more expensive over time, despite improvements in technology (such as [high-throughput screening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_screening "High-throughput screening"), [biotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology "Biotechnology"), [combinatorial chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_chemistry "Combinatorial chemistry"), and computational [drug design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_design "Drug design")), a trend first observed in the 1980s. The [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation")-adjusted cost of developing a new drug roughly doubles every nine years. In order to highlight the contrast with the exponential advancements of other forms of technology (such as [transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor "Transistor")) over time, the name given to the observation is [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law "Moore's law") spelled backwards.[[2020 Bikepacking trip through Belgium]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroom%27s_law#cite_note-2)

The idea is that new tech will always have to compete with old tech. Therefore, the results of a new drug must be better 'significantly' than an older drug, a new rock band must be better than The Beatles. This idea was triggered by [this article on lifescivc](https://lifescivc.com/2022/03/biotech-bears-jumping-a-lower-bar-or-a-higher-one/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=biotech-bears-jumping-a-lower-bar-or-a-higher-one)
