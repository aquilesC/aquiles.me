Stephen Quake (co-president Chan Zuckerberg Biohub) talks about free circulating DNA in human blood. The interesting thing is that the DNA is generated by cells, which means it could be an immediate biomarker for cancer, since those cells do not share the same genome as the rest of the body. The same is true for transplants, or pregnancies. 

The challenge is being able to capture the DNA, amplify it, and later detect it. He talks about [[liquid biopsy]] as one of the major breakthroughs to democratize access to new tech, but I don't know exactly what kind of assays are currently done.
