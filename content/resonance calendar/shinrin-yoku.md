The term emerged in Japan in the 1980s as a physiological and psychological exercise called _shinrin-yoku_(“forest bathing” or “taking in the forest atmosphere”). The purpose was twofold: to offer an eco-antidote to tech-boom burnout and to inspire residents to reconnect with and protect the country’s forests.
