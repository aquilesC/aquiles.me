The only way of defining social *mobility* is if one can determine social *position*. The mobility would therefore depict changes in position. However position is relative to the context. Therefore, social *mobility* can be judged at an individual level, but if one's mobility is ascending, it must be in detriment of another person. 

The challenge is to define therefore, the social *position* without resorting the measuring individual wealth. For example, we can judge access to food, health, education. In this way, everyone in a given society (including the whole world) can have ascending mobility, even though their relative *positions* do not change. 

This opens the second part of my concerns. Once the mobility is ascending, the relative position is meaningless unless it is for prejudice.
