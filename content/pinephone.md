# Pinephone
I came across a project called [Pinephone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/), a mobile phone that has [[Linux]] as its [[operating system]]. They also have tablets and system on a chip devices. 

The price is astonishing: 199U$ or 149U$ depending on version. 

It runs many different Linux distributions. It is a pity that Canonical stopped supporting Ubuntu Phone. It even allows connecting to an external screen and keyboard. 

This is how phones should have always been.
