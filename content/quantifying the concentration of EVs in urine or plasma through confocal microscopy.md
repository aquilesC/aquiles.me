It is possible to measure the number of [[extracellular vesicle]] in urine or plasma by following a protocol for immobilizing EV's in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. EV's are labeled (either specifically or non specifically) and then imaged with a confocal microscope[@hartjes2020]. 

This method is much more straightforward than [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] and it requires less sample preparation. It essentially boils down to finding bright spots in 3D and counting them. The protocol is nicknamed [[EVQuant]]. 

To measure absolute concentration it is crucial to calibrate the observation volume[@hartjes2020]. With this approach, the maximum concentration of particles that can be detected is around 10E11 pcles/ml, and the minimum is 5E8 pcles/ml. Although it is not clear why is there a minimum (perhaps it is given by the total observed volume)? This is not far from what the [[Dispertech]] device offers.
