This approach is radically different from [[literature/202303251644 Ideas-first product innovation is flawed|ideas-first innovation]]. The core principle is that if a company could map out the needs of their customers, then they would build a product addressing them (and thus, the discussion on [[product-market fit]] becomes altogether different). 

However, in [@ulwick], there is a point regarding how come that companies following this approach have such a large failure rate. 

Some of the techniques to gather information include: [[voice of customer]], [[lead user analysis]], and [[storytelling]]. 

The most likely cause is, therefore, that there is no common language to express a *need*. Customers may not even realize they have it. Many companies can't even produce a list of needs gathered during customer interviews. 

> Most managers, consultants, and academics agree that companies must look beyond the customer's own words to extract the kind of input that is needed, but they cannot seem to agree on whether or not a need is a description of customer benefit, a measure of customer value, a statement of a problem, or something else entirely. 

To add to the complications, there is a follow up idea that states that customers have *latent needs* that they can't articulate.
