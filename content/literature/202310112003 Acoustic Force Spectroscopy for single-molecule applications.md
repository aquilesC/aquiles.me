The idea of [[acoustic force spectroscopy]] relies on a relatively simple principle of [[Acoustic trapping]]. A standing pressure wave is created in a medium and particles will go towards the nodes. Particularly, in the setup described (figure below) the standing wave creates a planar structure, and therefore the trap only acts in 1-D.

And to show the parallelization capabilities, the authors create a series of histograms of distribution of rupture forces, but importantly, they show an example of how their data looks like:
