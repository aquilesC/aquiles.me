<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
0031-9007= We introduce a background-free real-time detection scheme capable of recognizing low-index nanoparticles such as single viruses in water. The method is based on interferometrically measuring the electromagnetic field amplitude of the scattered light. A split detector is used to generate a backgroundfree signal that renders unprecedented sensitivity for small particles. In its current configuration the sensor is capable of detecting low-index particles in water down to 10 nm in radius or single gold particles as small as 5 nm. We demonstrate the detection of such small particles in a microfluidic system with a time resolution of 1 ms and we discuss the theoretical limits of this novel detection scheme.
