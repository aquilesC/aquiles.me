<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
This review highlights recent trends in the development of multiplexed bioanalyses using quantum dot bioconjugates and donor-acceptor interactions. In these methods, multiple optical signals are generated in response to biorecognition through modulation of the photoluminescence of populations of quantum dots with different emission colors. The donor-acceptor interactions that have been used include fluorescence resonance energy transfer, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, charge transfer quenching, and quenching via proximal gold nanoparticles. Assays for the simultaneous detection of between two and eight target analytes have been developed, where spectral deconvolution is an important tool. Target analytes have included small molecules, nucleic acid sequences, and proteases. The unique optical properties of quantum dots offer several potential advantages in multiplexed detection, and a large degree of versatility, for example, one pot multiplexing at the ensemble level, where only wavelength discrimination is required to differentiate between detection channels. These methods are not being developed to compete with array-based technologies in terms of overall multiplexing capacity, but rather to enable new formats for multiplexed bioanalyses. In particular, quantum dot bioprobes based on donor-acceptor interactions are anticipated to provide future opportunities for multiplexed biosensing within living cells.
