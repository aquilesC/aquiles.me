There is some anecdotal information regarding the impacts of patents on the behavior of researchers, but proper analysis is mostly lacking. 

If [[patents create an anti-commons over knowledge]], it should be possible to observe that papers associated with patents receive fewer citations than papers without patents. In such pairs, it has been observed, indeed, that papers with a patent lower the number of citations by 9% to 17% after the patent has been granted (all the papers were in biotechnology). 

Also, a research done by AAAS found that 40% of researchers that were pursuing patenting of their research experienced delays in the dissemination of their work.
