<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
In the recent past a great deal of research efforts were directed toward the development of miniaturized gas-sensing devices, particularly for toxic gas detection and for pollution monitoring. Though various techniques are available for gas detection, solid state metal oxides offer a wide spectrum of materials and their sensitivities for different gaseous species, making it a better choice over other options. In this article a critical parameter analysis of different metal oxides that are known to be sensitive to various gaseous species are thoroughly examined. This includes phase of the oxide, sensing gaseous species, operating temperature range, and physical form of the material for the development of integrated gas sensors. The oxides that are covered in this study include oxides of aluminum, bismuth, cadmium, cerium, chromium, cobalt, copper, gallium, indium, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, niobium, ruthenium, tantalum, tin, titanium, tungsten, vanadium, zinc, zirconium, and the mixed or multi-component metal oxides. They cover gases such as CO, CO2, CH4, C2H5OH, C3H8, H2, H2S, NH3, NO, NO2, O2, O3, SO2, acetone, dimethylamine (DMA), humidity, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), petrol, trimethylamine (TMA), smoke, and many others. Both doped and undoped oxides are analyzed for the compatibility with silicon processing conditions and hybrid microcircuit fabrication techniques. In silicon processing conditions, they are further analyzed for the suitability for simple silicon surfaces, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) surfaces, and micromachined silicon geometries for different operating temperatures. Discussion on gas-sensing properties of each material and its applications are described in the text in alphabetical order of the elemental oxides. Further, the gas-sensing properties like sensitivity, detection limits, operating temperature, and so on are summarized in tables al ong with relevant references. The figures incorporated in the present review are primarily based on discussions and data in tables. However, these figures provide a qualitative comparison and present a pictorial view to examine suitability of a material for a particular application. From the known parameters, the present study clearly indicates the suitability of certain materials and the gases that they cover for the development of integrated micro gas sensors. A clear picture has been brought out for the development of silicon-based processing technology. Various parameters are discussed for the selection of these materials, to examine their suitability and practical problems that are being associated. Etching of these metal oxides and the reliability of devices are also discussed.
