<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
High-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA-NPs) are important class of materials with significant technological potential. However, the strategies for synthesizing uniformly dispersed HEA-NPs on granular supports such as carbon materials, γ-Al2O3, and zeolite, which is vital to their practical applications, are largely unexplored. Herein, we present a fast moving bed pyrolysis strategy to immobilize HEA-NPs on granular supports with a narrow size distribution of 2 nm up to denary (MnCoNiCuRhPdSnIrPtAu) HEA-NPs at 923 K. Fast moving bed pyrolysis strategy ensures the mixed metal precursors rapidly and simultaneously pyrolyzed at high temperatures, resulting in nuclei with a small size. The representative quinary (FeCoPdIrPt) HEA-NPs exhibit high stability (150 h) toward hydrogen evolution reaction with high mass activity, which is 26 times higher than the commercial Pt/C at an overpotential of 100 mV. Our strategy provides an improved methodology for synthesizing HEA-NPs on various supports.
