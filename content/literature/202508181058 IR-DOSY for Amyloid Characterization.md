This is a follow up of [[202508181023 IR-DOSY for molecular size and structure]], where the method of [[Optical DOSY]] is applied to the characterization of amyloids. 

The paper describes the equation used to extract information:

I still need to parse through it, I definitely do not fully understand the derivation (or how the fitting actually works.)


The approach to measuring [[amylods]] monomers and fibrils is by comparing the 2D-FTIR spectra in two different regions after 24 hours:

The challenge is that you have the guarantee that the sample is stable for so long, and that you don't have thermal convection in the channel, since that could greatly affect the performance of the measurements.
