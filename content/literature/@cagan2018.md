Has some interesting insights on how product teams need to be organized to be the best versions of themselves. 

Topics that I found interesting: 
- [[Product vision and product strategy]]
	- [[Product Vision]]
- [[OKR for product management]]
- [[Roadmaps for product development]]
- Understanding the [[minimum viable product]] as a [[minimum viable prototype]]. 
- Defining [[who are stakeholders]] and bring this back to the product team. If the product teams delivers and then there's a veto, trust of the product team will be eroded ([[build trust in a team]]). The [[product manager]] needs to be sure to understand the constrains and work towards finding *solutions*. 
- Communicating product learnings along the way. What worked and (especially) what didn't work. It needs to be concise and short, probably handled by VP Product during all-hands meetings (with different cadences).
