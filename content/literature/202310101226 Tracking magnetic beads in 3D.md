Using [[Stereo Darkfield Interferometry]] (see paper: [[literature/202310101212 Stereo Darkfield Interferometry|Stereo Darkfield Interferometry]]) it is possible to perform force-extension measurements by using [[magnetic nanoparticles]] under a [[magnetic tweezer]]. 

The biggest advantage of *SDI* is that allows for multiple particles to be tracked at once:

In this case, the most relevant parameter is the position along the optical axis ($\hat{z}$) which is encoded in the rotation of the intereference pattern recorded on the camera. 

Applications to DNA hybridization:

And helicase stepping:

Come as natural applications. 

It is worth noting that the presence of [[brownian motion]] is the real limit to the accuracy of these measurements. [[magnetic tweezer]] does not have infinite stiffness. 

The **temporal resolution** limit of the method comes from these thermal fluctuations than from the optical resolution itself or the data-transfer rate from the camera.
