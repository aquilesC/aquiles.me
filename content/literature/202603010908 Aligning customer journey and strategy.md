The traditional [[sales funnel]] is outdated for the modern customer journey. Many customers engage with our offering, disengage, reengage at a later point. There are many steps that are not within our control: from customers reading a paper, to attending a presentation. 

We should not force a linear trajectory to our customers, but rather support them along the way ([[literature/202603010858 Buying journey aligned with messaging|202603010858 Buying journey aligned with messaging]]). 

We need to find signals of **authority**, for example by having a strong or provocative point of view. 

We should create **likeness**, since most people feel attracted to others who are similar. 

People like **consistency**. If they asked for more information, they should be reminded that they asked for it. That triggers better reception and less cognitive stress. 

**Availability** of a problem is not always clear to customers. If you ask: "how often do you encounter this problem", they will disengage emotionally. It is a data-driven question. While asking "when was the last time X happened?" will force them to remember and put themselves in the painful situation. 

If we provide value before asking for it, we create **reciprocity**. And this is a very powerful tool when we want to influence someone. First give, then ask. 

**Consensus** is perhaps the most utilized tool: show that others are already doing it, they are already your customers, it's the social-proof.
