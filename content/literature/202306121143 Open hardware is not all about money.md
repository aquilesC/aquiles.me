The paper asks the question on whether **is it all about money** when discussing [[open hardware]] projects. 

This is a question particularly interesting for me, and that is not always asked nor answered. Many [[open hardware projects focus on cutting costs]], but "openness" can be more, it can be a way for transferring knowledge across boundaries. It can empower local fabrication, increasing the accessibility of tools. 

Surprisingly, the paper cites the [[Flamingo project]] as an example of why giving tools to biologists as early as possible can be useful to collect feedback. 

**Local Fabrication** is key to ensure accessibility also in times of strain to the supply chain (as the COVID pandemic has shown). A distributed system is more reliable under unexpected circumstances than a centralized approach.
