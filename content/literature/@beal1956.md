More than a paper, this is a collection of papers that were presented during a conference. Around 20 works were summarized. 

The focus was **how farmers adopt new ideas**, from which the following curve was derived (today known as the [[adoption curve]]):

Interestingly, the paper also defines different stages, extremely similar to the [[levels of awareness for marketing]]:

- The **Awareness** stage: an individual becomes *aware* of a new idea. Knows about the existence, but lacks details concerning it. 
- The **Interest** stage: an individual wants more information about the idea or product. Essentially, he wants to understand the *value* of the offering. 
- The **Evaluation** stage: the individual makes a mental trial of the idea. Tries to apply the gathered information in situations he has experienced in the past. 
- The **Trial** stage: If the evaluation is successful, the individual will try the solution or idea, probably in a small-scale experimental setting (**important**: they need to understand how to make it work *for* them)
- The **Adoption** stage: once the trial concludes, the most important is that there'll be *satisfaction* about the idea. This means there'll be a large-scale, continuous use of the idea. It means the person has accepted the idea as *good* and will consider it in the future, not that there's a *constant* use of it. 


The paper also discusses that people seek information from different sources at different stages. For example, *awareness* can be made by mass-media, while at interest and evaluation stages they rely on friends and neighbors for information. 

Surprisingly, *sales people* are systematically ranked last as any source of information, except at the trial stage if there's need for specific instructions on how to use equipment.
