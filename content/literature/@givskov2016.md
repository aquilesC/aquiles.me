<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
The so-called Rolling Circle Amplification allows for amplification of circular DNA structures in a manner that can be detected in real-time using nucleotide-based molecular beacons that unfold upon recognition of the DNA product, which is being produced during the amplification process. The unfolding of the molecular beacons results in a fluorescence increase as the Rolling Circle Amplification proceeds. This can be measured in a fluorometer. In the current study, we have investigated the possibility of using two different molecular beacons to detect two distinct Rolling Circle Amplification reactions proceeding simultaneously and in the same reaction tube by measurement of fluorescence over time. We demonstrate the application of this fluorometric readout method, for automated and specific detection of the activity of the type IB topoisomerase from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in the presence of human cell extract containing the related topoisomerase I from humans. The obtained results point towards a future use of the presented assay setup for malaria diagnostics or drug screening purposes. In longer terms the method may be applied more broadly for real-time sensing of various Rolling Circle Amplification reactions.
