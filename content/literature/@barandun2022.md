<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
, Printed electrical
gas sensors are a low-cost, lightweight, low-power,
and potentially disposable alternative to gas sensors manufactured
using conventional methods such as photolithography, etching, and
chemical vapor deposition. The growing interest in Internet-of-Things,
smart homes, wearable devices, and point-of-need sensors has been
the main driver fueling the development of new classes of printed
electrical gas sensors. In this Perspective, we provide an insight
into the current research related to printed electrical gas sensors
including materials, methods of fabrication, and applications in monitoring
food quality, air quality, diagnosis of diseases, and detection of
hazardous gases. We further describe the challenges and future opportunities
for this emerging technology.
