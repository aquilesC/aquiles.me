<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
With the growing focus and development on the industrialization of the research and development (R&D) outcomes of universities, academic patents have witnessed significant growth in recent years. However, previous development directions for the technologies of academic patents have mostly focused on patents approved by or applied for with major patent offices; few have examined from the perspective of standard-essential patents (SEPs). This study examined key technologies of academic SEPs through network analysis. The findings revealed that most of the key technologies of academic SEPs are involved in wireless communication networks and the transmission of digital information, electric digital data processing, control or regulating systems, and secret communication systems. Among these, secret communication systems are key technologies in academia, and more scientific research resources should be invested in secret communication R&D in the future. In addition, the key technologies of academic SEPs have changed; specifically, image coding technology has undergone major developments. Accordingly, this study developed a key technology network model for academic standard-essential patents to verify those academic technologies that are vital to industrial applications.
