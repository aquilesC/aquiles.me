Once the segments are clear ([[literature/202603010904 Properly segmenting the market|202603010904 Properly segmenting the market]]) we have to find a way of developing a [[Value proposition]] that offers clear positioning for each group. 

**Positioning** consists of 3 things: 
- **Formal positioning statement**, which is rigorous and should contain all the relevant information that describes how the offering is situated in the marketplace. 
- **Value proposition**, is the central statement that describes the value of an offering to an audience. 
- **Core claims to value**, are supporting proof-points that substantiate the value proposition. 

## Formal positioning statement

**For** (*audience*)
**Who need** (independent of the offering),
**The** (offering name and category), **provides** (benefit),
**Unlike** (competitive forces), **offering** (is different in a unique way). 

> Marketing and sales efforts based on a deep understanding of the audience's needs will be much more effective than company-centric and self-serving efforts. Technical professionals recognize and reward this effort with their attention and engagement. 

**Category design** means creating a category based on a new offering. However, this is normally much more difficult than using well defined categories. 

**Benefits** are the answers to the audience's pains. 

**Competitive forces** are so much more than direct competing products. It is workflows, alternative protocols, etc. 

**Differentiator**, what makes the offering unique. There has to be something that allows to distinguish this product from the others. It's more **art than science**. 

## Value proposition 

> We are the only [X] that solves [Y] in a unique [Z] way. 

The value proposition should guide the audience to form a hypothesis for themselves about how to satisfy their need. 

## Core claims to value

Supporting proof points that validate your value proposition. They are not raw specs, but explanations, connecting product features to audience benefit.
