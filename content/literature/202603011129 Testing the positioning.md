After [[literature/202603010905 Defining positioning|202603010905 Defining positioning]], it is important to test it:

**Does it cut the market like a knife**: it should split the market in two very well defined groups, those who are your potential customers and the rest. 
- **Does it tell the truth**: "*coloring the truth*" is commercial malpractice. Commercial teams should work harder to solve the challenge rather than resort to coloring realities. 
- **Does it avoid hyperbole**: Since positioning is an internal document, hyperbole normally points to deeper problems within the company and its offering. 
- **Does it retrofit the audience needs**: never reverse-engineer the audience needs to fit the product attributes. 
- **Does it focus on a single benefit**: precise benefit for a specific audience. If there are more benefits for the same audience, either pick one or work harder to distill multiple benefits into one statement. 

The overarching topics are: [[positioning within the market]], [[new market positioning]]
