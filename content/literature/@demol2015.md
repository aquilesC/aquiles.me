<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
In this study, we investigate how passion diversity affects the performance of entrepreneurial teams. We propose a model in which different diversity dimensions of passion, separation and variety, bring about distinct effects on entrepreneurial team performance. Drawing on a unique data set composed of longitudinal archival and survey data collected on 77 entrepreneurial teams, we found support for the positive effect of team passion on venture performance. Contrary to our expectations the results did not confirm significant effects of passion intensity variety and passion focus separation, hereby questioning the importance of affective diversity in explaining entrepreneurial team outcomes. In addition our findings reveal that team passion is associated with higher performance when relational resources are low and with lower performance when relational resources are high. Overall these findings contribute to understanding how affective diversity operates within entrepreneurial teams in a way that is distinct from what is known from studies on team diversity.
