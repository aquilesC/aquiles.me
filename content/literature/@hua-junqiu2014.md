<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Due to their extraordinary electrical and optical properties, dealloyed nanoporous metals and their derivatives have stimulated increasing interest in their sensing applications ever since dealloying was proposed to be a good strategy to fabricate uniform nanoporous metals. This article comprehensively and critically reviews the emerging nanoporous metal-based electrochemical, electronic, and optical sensors for both biological and chemical detection. We emphasize the underlying detection (or signal transduction) mechanisms, the unique roles and advantages/disadvantages of dealloyed nanoporous metals in sensing. Properties and preparations of different nanoporous metals, and their functionalizations are also highlighted in view of sensor developments. Finally, the perspective and current challenges of nanoporous metal-based sensing are outlined.
