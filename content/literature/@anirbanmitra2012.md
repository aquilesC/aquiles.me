<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
The fast detection and characterization of nanoparticles, such as viruses or environmental pollutants, are important in fields ranging from biosensing to quality control. However, most existing techniques have practical throughput limitations, which significantly limit their applicability to low analyte concentrations. Here, we present an integrated nanofluidic scheme for preconcentration and subsequent detection of nanoparticle samples within a continuous flow-through system. Using a Brownian ratchet mechanism, we increase the nanoparticle concentration âˆ¼27-fold. Single nanoparticles are subsequently detected and characterized by optical heterodyne interferometry. A wide range of potential applications can be foreseen, including real-time analysis of clinically relevant virus samples and contamination control of processing fluids used in the semiconductor industry.
