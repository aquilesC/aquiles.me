The Asymmetric Field Flow Fractionation coupled to DLS and MALS is a powerful approach to measuring the size distribution of nanoparticles (see: [[202111301045]]). However it also has limitations, namely, that each particle requires a specific protocol. Method optimization can be very laborious, and it is hard to optimize the results when thereâ€™s a severe lack of orthogonal approaches to gain insight into the truth. 

Sample loss in the channel and the challenges of the data analysis are specific problems that will arise once the method is implemented in different contexts. Ideally, comparison with electron microscope would yield a baseline on which to base the optimization protocol. 

The goal would be to develop an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) that allows the monitoring of the quality of the nanoparticles and their bio-medical properties.
