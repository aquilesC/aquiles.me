<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
The present study examines the effectiveness of integrating 5th grade students as part of citizen science aimed at preserving the Lesser Kestrel. The study examined the quality of the database collected by the students. During the project, students used mobile phones and the Survey123 app for locating nesting boxes for the Lesser Kestrel. The application provides a simple data collection solutions using online forms, enabling the students to create, share, and analyze surveys with a geographic location component. The study used a mixed-method approach to examine the efficiency of data collection by 5th and to examine student perceptions of the surveyâ€™s outcome. The results indicate that the database was not effective due to lack of sufficient reliable quality data. However, even the partial data collected raise concerns for the future of the Lesser Kestrel population in the area. In addition, the study also revealed that the survey (a) contributed to positive learning experiences, (b) increased motivation and (c) strengthened the social relationship among the students.
