<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
In this paper a microflow injection analysis (FIA) is presented, which was developed completely in printed circuit board (PCB) technology. The multilayer printed circuit board, which was made as stack of four individual printed circuit boards, contains both the passive and active fluid elements, and necessary electronics for the control and evaluation. For a reference reaction the FIA detects Fe3+. A calibration curve was recorded and a reproducibility measurement was carried out. An accuracy of 10% was reached. Data acquisition and control was made with the help of a PC and a Labview-program.
