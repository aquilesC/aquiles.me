<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
In this paper we present a new procedure for tracking bi-directional objects in kymographs. The proposed technique is based on a novel adaptive and directional band-pass ﬁltering method which allows us to separate particles which move in opposite directions. The ﬁltering method exploits the curvelet analysis of the kymograph image to automatically adapt to the objects trails characteristics and select oriented features. The separation of bi-directional objects in separated images allows us to reliably detect and track ﬂuorescent particles in ﬂuorescence image sequences, despite numerous crossroad points in the kymograph space. The new abilities provided by the proposed technique are highlighted by the analysis of biological images which were previously impossible to analyze reliably.
