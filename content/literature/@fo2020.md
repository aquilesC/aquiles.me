<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Tracking and analyzing the individual diﬀusion of nanoscale objects such as proteins and viruses is an important methodology in life science. Here, we show a sensor that combines the eﬃciency of light line illumination with the advantages of ﬂuidic conﬁnement. Tracking of freely diﬀusing nano-objects inside water-ﬁlled hollow core ﬁbers with core diameters of tens of micrometers using elastically scattered light from the core mode allows retrieving information about the Brownian motion and the size of each particle of the investigated ensemble individually using standard tracking algorithms and the mean squared displacement analysis. Speciﬁcally, we successfully measure the diameter of every gold nanosphere in an ensemble that consists of several hundreds of 40 nm particles, with an individual precision below 17% (±8 nm). In addition, we conﬁrm the relevance of our approach with respect to bioanalytics by analyzing 70 nm λ-phages. Overall these features, together with the strongly reduced demand for memory space, principally allows us to record thousands of frames and to achieve high frame rates for high precision tracking of nanoscale objects.
