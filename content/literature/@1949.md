<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
ECONOMIC and material loss through corrosion of metals is divided into (a) direct loss resulting from protection costs and replacement of corroded equipment and (b) an incalculable, often higher, indirect loss through shutdown, over-design, loss of product and efficiency, explosion, and contamination. Direct loss by corrosion, although amenable to analysis, still is difficult to estimate. A survey of this kind is almost always incomplete and is subject to a wide range of interpretation. Nevertheless, it is believed that annual cost to the United States, tabulated later in detail and amounting to over $5,500 million, represents the present-day tax exacted directly by the ravages of corrosion and is the correct order of magnitude. Previous estimates in the order of $500 million to $1,000 million dollars are definitely too low. Not all of the material loss can be prevented. Metals persist in reverting to their ores or to compounds of lower energy despite corrosion protection; and ...
