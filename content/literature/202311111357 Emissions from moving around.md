Many things fall in the definition of "Moving around". The image below is a perfect summary:

The emissions happen from the combustion of fossil fuels in motors. Changing to electric vehicles seems the obvious transition, provided we can generate enough clean electricity ([[literature/202311101914 The problem with electricy|202311101914 The problem with electricy]]). 

For other types of transportation, however, batteries will never cut it ([[literature/202111292230 diesel is the most efficient energy storage solution for transport|202111292230 diesel is the most efficient energy storage solution for transport]]). Alternative fuels, like *biofuels* are net-zero (they emit $CO_2$ while burning, but they have captured an equal amount while being made). 

For ships, the next transition is nuclear-powered, as is already the case for some military ships. 

The strategy would be to electrify as much as we can, and use clean fuel for the things we can't, like airplanes.
