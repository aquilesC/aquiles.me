There is a fine distinction to be made between "[[open hardware]]" and "DIY" tools. The definition of Open Hardware includes the right to repurpose, sell, distribute, etc. while in many DIY cases it is mostly a "recipe" to be followed in order to get a setup working. 

There is also an important aspect to consider, which is the role open-hardware can have in low-resource settings, especially when it is built around [[Frugal Science]] principles, or when it is designed to use digital fabrication tools (such as 3D printers) as their manufacturing principle. 

In some low resource settings, one of the problems is access to technicians that can troubleshoot and support equipment. It is also worth mentioning that open hardware initiatives seem to be triggered in contexts of high-resources and specifically in countries with a well developed tech/scientific industrial matrix. 

>[CNC milling], they are common in most countries and, therefore, suitable to local fabrication through local services. 

I think there is a bit of a problem in the boundary between DIY and open-hardware. A well-documented paper should fall in the category of DIY. For example, the microscope I used during [[my phd]] was home-built and documented, but didn't use a Raspberry Pi nor an Arduino (two conditions for a paper to appear as DIY). Therefore, in the overlap of "maker" and "lab setting", there's still a lot of space to define what is "open", what is reproducible, etc. 

## Is it all about money?
Interesting question, that is not always asked nor answered. Many [[open hardware projects focus on cutting costs]], but "openness" can be more, it can be a way for transferring knowledge across boundaries. It can empower local fabrication, increasing the accessibility. Surprisingly, the paper cites the [[flamingo project]] as an example no why giving tools to biologists as early as possible can be useful to collect feedback. 

**Local Fabrication** is key to ensure accessibility also in times of strain to the supply chain (as the COVID pandemic has shown). A distributed system is more reliable under unexpected circumstances than a centralized approach.

The author identifies 10 possible situations for open/DIY approaches. Surprisingly, the only one that can be cited in the "sweet spot" is the [[Open Flexure]] project. The "Expensive assembly" should not be neglected, as is, potentially, the first approach many researchers can follow, without the extra burden of going the "open hardware" route, without sacrificing chances at protecting the IP, and ensuring reproducibility. 

The author also proposes to follow an open approach to bypass the roles of the TTO (see: [[open hardware should not be a strategy to overcome licensing]]). It clearly says:

> Sometimes, academics are also prevented from open-sourcing their potentially patentable developments. This is one more reason to work openly from the start of a project and release documentation as the research develops, enabling early collaboration and feedback. With such an approach, there is no point in time at which an institutionally problematic amount of intellectual property is released. The “open from the start” model also avoids the backlog of documentation tasks left for final deadlines. 

I find this statement misleading and careless. Bypassing the TTO office is not the proper way to go. Educating the TTO's on the power of open-hardware can be a much more suitable approach. After all, it is within the employers prerogative to decide on licensing, not on the employees.
