<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Several vaccines against COVID-19 use nanoparticles to protect the antigen cargo (either proteins or nucleic acids), increase the immunogenicity and ultimately the efficacy. The characterization of these nanomedicines is challenging due to their intrinsic complexity and requires the use of multidisciplinary techniques and competencies. The accurate characterization of nanovaccines can be conceptualized as a combination of physicochemical, immunological and toxicological assays. This will help to address key challenges in the preclinical characterization, will guide the rapid development of safe and effective vaccines for current and future health crises, and will streamline the regulatory process.
