To fully understand Inca cosmology or any other system to understand reality we should develop *a completely new ontology*. For example, in order to understand why and how Inca’s built different [[huacas]]. The idea is that if Inca’s viewed sacred places as living organisms, and they removed the duality of live/dead (see: [[cartesian dualism]]), then we can see shrines as actual powerful *beings*, not only places. 

In this light, Cusco is actually protected by a belt of huacas that connect to the inner seats of power. This places had running water as a symbolism for a living organism. Although, I believe using the word *symbolism* is imposing an etnohistoric interpretation that may not be correct. From the perspective that a huaca is an actual living organism, running water may be of vital importance for its survival, in pretty much the same way blood keeps animals alive.
