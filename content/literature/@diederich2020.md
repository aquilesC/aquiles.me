<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Super-resolution microscopy allows for stunning images with a resolution well beyond the optical diffraction limit, but the imaging techniques are demanding in terms of instrumentation and software. Using scientific-grade cameras, solid-state lasers and top-shelf microscopy objective lenses drives the price and complexity of the system, limiting its use to well-funded institutions. However, by harnessing recent developments in CMOS image sensor technology and low-cost illumination strategies, super-resolution microscopy can be made available to the mass-markets for a fraction of the price. Here, we present a 3D printed, self-contained super-resolution microscope with a price tag below 1000 $ including the objective and a cellphone. The system relies on a cellphone to both acquire and process images as well as control the hardware, and a photonic-chip enabled illumination. The system exhibits 100nm optical resolution using single-molecule localization microscopy and can provide live super-resolution imaging using light intensity fluctuation methods. Furthermore, due to its compactness, we demonstrate its potential use inside bench-top incubators and high biological safety level environments imaging SARS-CoV-2 viroids. By the development of low-cost instrumentation and by sharing the designs and manuals, the stage for democratizing super-resolution imaging is set.
