<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
A survey of more than 19,000 HBR readers found that one particular culture style differentiated the diverse and inclusive organizations from those that were not: a learning-oriented culture that emphasizes flexibility, open-mindedness, and exploration, and can equip organizations with the ability to adapt and innovate. To foster a learning-centric culture, leaders should lead by example: being open to new ideas, failure, and feedback; sharing how their own perspectives have changed over time; and recognizing those that think outside the box and take risks.
