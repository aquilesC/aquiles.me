<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Microfluidic technologies are frequently employed as point-of-care diagnostic tools for improving time-to-diagnosis and improving patient outcomes in clinical settings. These microfluidic devices often are designed to operate with peripheral equipment for liquid handling that increases the cost and complexity of these systems and reduces their potential for widespread adoption in low resource healthcare applications. Here, we present a low-cost (~$120), open-source peristaltic pump constructed with a combination of three dimensional (3D)-printed parts and common hardware, which is amenable to deployment with microfluidic devices for point-of-care diagnostics. This pump accepts commonly available silicone rubber tubing in a range of sizes from 1.5 to 3 mm, and is capable of producing flow rates up to 1.6 mL min−1. This device is programmed with an Arduino microcontroller, allowing for custom flow profiles to fit a wide range of low volume liquid handling applications including precision liquid aliquoting, flow control within microfluidics, and generation of physiologically relevant forces for studying cellular mechanobiology within microfluidic systems.
