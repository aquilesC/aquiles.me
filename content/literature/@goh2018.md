<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
A hybrid drug delivery platform involving the fusion of cell membranes from U937 monocytes and synthetic lipids to create nano-cell vesicle technology systems (nCVTs) is designed. nCVTs are engineered for a targeted approach towards tumour sites by preserving key surface proteins from U937 monocytes, while being amendable to functionalization and loading due to their liposomal components.
