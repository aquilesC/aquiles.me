The most interesting aspect is trying to define the "**Index of Entrepreneurial Activity**" and out of a series of factors, which ones can better predict the outcome. 

The biggest blindspot is that they performed a survey sending e-mails to university employees. Which means, any entrepreneurial activity carried on by former employees (like a PhD or a Postdoc) will not appear counted. 

Secondly, instead of scanning the patent database and draw conclusions from there, they ask people if they've been engaged in patenting activities. As a methodological approach is not robust enough (they could have quantified their response bias, for example.)

Nevertheless, the conclusions they can draw (even if from a sample which is not statistically relevant, less than 10% of respondents have some entrepreneurial activity, which is just 20 participants) is that almost no studied parameter is a clear indicator of activity. Gender has a low correlation, laboratory size es not very significant. Also age is not that predictive. 

The biggest correlative factor is the number of engagements with industry. Which points to a clear policy that can be taken to increase entrepreneurial activity in academia: enhance private/public partnerships in which academics are exposed to the problems of industry.
