This paper displays an approach very similar to the one implemented by [[Dispertech]], just that instead of using [[hollow optical fiber]], they use a nano-fluidic chip with a rectangular cross section. The other difference is that they use a dark-field illumination approach, and instead of detecting the direct [[scattering from the particle]], they measure in a mode similar to [[iSCAT]] (see also: [[literature/202212091127 iSCAT for refractive index of EVs|202212091127 iSCAT for refractive index of EVs]]). 

The principle of operation is that the nano-channel becomes a scatterer (sub-diffraction), and the particle inside creates an interference pattern that can be detected by a microscope. Signal is processed similarly to iSCAT, but in this case particles are moving in 1-D.
