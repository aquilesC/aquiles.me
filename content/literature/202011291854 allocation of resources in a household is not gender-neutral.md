In households lead by women, i.e. in which women have a higher say on how resources are allocated, the expenditure is different than in households lead by men. This means that when evaluating poverty, one must also consider who is the resource manager of the household (see: [[The zombie stat]]). This is poorly done, but it may be pointing to showing that women can, in fact, be poor even if the household is not in that category.
