<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
The aim of this paper is to introduce reflective digital holographic microscopy (rDHM) as a new method for quantitative evaluation of corrosion. Despite the commonly-used evaluation methods, rDHM does not require scanning, while it measures the microstructural height profile of the corroded sample surface within a macroscale area. Based on the height profile across the corroded grain boundaries, a quantitative criterion is suggested to distinguish between intergranular and transgranular corrosion. The experimental results show the capability of rDHM to analyse the microstructural corrosion in AISI 304 stainless steel. The presented method can also be applied as a surface characterization method for analysis of a variety of metallurgic effects such as crystal elasticity and crystal orientation.
