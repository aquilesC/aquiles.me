The biggest problem with *making things* is cement. Cement releases CO2 when it is made: to get calcium, you burn limestone which contains also carbon and oxygen. The product is that by every ton of cement, there'll be a ton of CO2 liberated. 

Coupled to the massive urban grow, these are quantities of emissions that need to be replaced. 

Making steel also generates CO2 at the moment in which iron ore is heated together with coke. Part of the carbon binds to iron, but the rest binds to oxygen. The ratio is 1.8 tons of CO2 per ton of steel. 

**Plastics** are radically different, since they are actually storing part of the carbon *in them*. 

**Sadly**, there is no way of making *green* cement or iron available or speculated now a days. This means that the only opportunity available is that of [[carbon capture]].
