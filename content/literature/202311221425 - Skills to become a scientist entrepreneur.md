> We want postdoctoral appointments to be transformative experiences that nurture the next generation of research leaders across academia and industry.

Although I overall agree with the take of this short note, I believe there are many caveats that are not even advanced. 

First, the authors are highly biased. They are researchers that may have a very partial view on the job market and career choices. Instead of inviting a third author with a broader perspective, they keep pushing their own agenda. 

Secondly, they focus on a dichotomy academia/industry because **academia is a one way street**. You can only move out, but not move in. From that light, they embrace the full spirit of neoliberal universities, in which their only role is to develop the skills necessary for their students to join the workforce. 

What is the limit of what is expected from a doctoral/postdoctoral position?
