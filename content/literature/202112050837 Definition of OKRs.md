**OKR** means: Objective and Key Results. The idea was developed by Andy Grove, a manager of Intel in the 70s (or 80s). 

**Objectives**: The ambition of a company, division, or individual. They are stated as the end-goal within a given time frame. They should be developed in a way that makes it clear whether the objective has been met or no. 

**Key Results**: These are the steps that allow to reach the objectives. They must be stated in a way that is measurable. For example: *Reaching X users before Y date*. If all the key results are obtained, the Objective must be accomplished.
