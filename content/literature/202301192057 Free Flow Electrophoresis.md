The idea behind the technique is applying an electric field perpendicular to the direction of the flow of a solution containing the analyte, and the BGE, background electrolyte. Analyte is then separated based on electrophoretic mobility at the end of the channel. 

Some **concerns** with the method are: 
- Joule heating of the sample (there's some effort put on heat dissipation in the design of the instruments). This is a concern because thermal gradients will generate sample separation in directions that may not be aligned with the electrophoretic mobility. 
- A membrane must be used to separate the electrodes
- There are some local-zone effects with the charges
- Flow-rate/resolution are linked (faster allows for lower separation)
- Band broadening and dilution of the separated compounds. 
- Differences in conductivity between sample and background electrolyte lead to *electrohydrodynamic* distortions. 
- Longer residence time may increase band broadening due to diffusion (but seems to be a small effect). 

There are different implementations of free-flow electrophoresis, including:

- [[free flow electrophoresis]]
- [[Isotachophoresis]]
- Free-flow [[isoelectric focusing]]
- Recycling zone electrophoresis
