<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Nanoporous metals possess unique properties attributed to their high surface area and interconnected nanoscale ligaments. They are mostly fabricated by wet synthetic methods that are not universal to various metals and not free from impurities due to solution-based etching processes. Here, we demonstrate that the plasma treatment of metal nanoparticles formed by physical vapor deposition is a general route to form such films with many metals including the non-noble ones. The resultant nanoporous metallic films are free of impurities and possess highly curved ligaments and nanopores. The metal films are ultrathin, yet remarkably robust and very well connected, and thus are highly promising for various applications such as transparent conducting electrodes.
