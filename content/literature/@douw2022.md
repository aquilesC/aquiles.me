<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
There is an ongoing need for novel biomarkers in clinical neuroscience, as diagnosis of neurological and psychiatric disorders is hampered by the pronounced overlap of behavioral symptoms and other pathophysiological characteristics. The question that this Focus Feature puts center stage is whether network-based biomarkers may provide a viable tool for distinguishing between disordered populations or whether they may yield only limited differentiating power because of largely shared network characteristics across conditions.
