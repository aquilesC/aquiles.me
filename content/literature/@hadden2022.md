<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Functional nanoporous materials are categorized as an important class of nanostructured materials because of their tunable porosity and pore geometry (size, shape, and distribution) and their unique chemical and physical properties as compared with other nanostructures and bulk counterparts. Progress in developing a broad spectrum of nanoporous materials has accelerated their use for extensive applications in catalysis, sensing, separation, and environmental, energy, and biomedical areas. The purpose of this review is to provide recent advances in synthesis strategies for designing ordered or hierarchical nanoporous materials of tunable porosity and complex architectures. Furthermore, we briefly highlight working principles, potential pitfalls, experimental challenges, and limitations associated with nanoporous material fabrication strategies. Finally, we give a forward look at how digitally controlled additive manufacturing may overcome existing obstacles to guide the design and development of next-generation nanoporous materials with predefined properties for industrial manufacturing and applications.
