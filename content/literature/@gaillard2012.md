<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Free flow electrophoresis (FFE) is a fractionation method, based on isoelectric focusing (IEF). We validate the reproducibility of the method and show that it can be applied by biobanks in order to fractionate fluid biospecimens efficiently and reproducibly and to facilitate downstream proteomic applications. We also propose a simple method allowing researchers to assess the reproducibility of each FFE run.
