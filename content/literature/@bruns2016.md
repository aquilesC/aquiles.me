<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Two miniaturized fibre-coupled modules for light sheet-based microscopy are described and compared with respect to image quality, chromatic aberration and beam alignment. Whereas in one module the light sheet is created by an achromatic cylindrical lens, reflection by a spherical mirror and concomitant astigmatic distortion are used to create the light sheet in the second module. Test experiments with fluorescent dyes in solution and multicellular tumour spheroids are reported, and some details on construction are given for both systems. Both modules are optimized for imaging individual cell layers of 3D biological samples and can be adapted to fit commercial microscopes.
