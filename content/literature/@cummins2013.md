<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Electrokinetic tweezing in three dimensions is achieved for the first time using a multi-layer microfluidic device, a model-based control algorithm, and a 3D imaging algorithm connected in a feedback loop. Here we demonstrate steering of microparticles along 3D trajectories and trapping in all three dimensions with accuracy as good as 1 Î¼m.
