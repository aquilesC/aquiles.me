OKRs (see: [[literature/202112050837 Definition of OKRs]]) are a management tool (not an individual performance metric) that allow to align the interests within an organization. OKRs are based on absolute transparency and accountability within a group of people. There's no partial implementation, meaning that from the CEO downwards every person should define their own OKR and they should be publicly accessible. 

In this way, the objectives of a company become publicly known, each department and each individual within them can therefore align to the overall interests of the organization without having to receive explicit instructions. The power of the OKRs resides in the horizontal accountability. If objectives or key results are not met, a *post-mortem* can be performed to understand what happened and avoid the same failure in the future.
