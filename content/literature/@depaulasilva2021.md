<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are mediators of the immune system response. Encapsulated in EVs, microRNAs can be transferred between cancer and immune cells. To define the potential effects of EVs originated from squamous cell carcinoma cells on immune system response, we performed microRNA profiling of EVs released from two distinct cell lines and treated dendritic cells derived from circulating monocytes (mono-DCs) with these EVs. We confirmed the internalization of EVs by mono-DCs and the down-regulation of microRNA mRNA targets in treated mono-DCs. Differences in surface markers of dendritic cells cultivated in the presence of EVs indicated that their content disrupts the maturation process. Additionally, microRNAs known to interfere with dendritic cell function, and detected in EVs, matched microRNAs from squamous cell carcinoma patients' plasma: miR-17-5p in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, miR-21 in oral squamous cell carcinoma, miR-16, miR-24, and miR-181a circulating in both oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and miR-23b, which has not been previously described in plasma of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, was found in plasma from patients with these cancer subtypes. This study contributes with insights on EVs in signaling between cancer and immune cells in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
