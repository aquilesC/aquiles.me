<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Supportive attitudes can bring to a blossoming science, while neglect can quickly make science absent from everyday life and provide a very primitive view of the world. We compare one important Greek achievement, the computation of the Earth meridian by Eratosthenes, to its later interpretation by the Roman historian of science Pliny.
