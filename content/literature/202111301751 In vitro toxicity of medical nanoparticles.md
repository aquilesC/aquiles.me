Studying in vitro toxicity of MedNP is helpful in the early phase of development, and is an essential part of the [[3R Principle]]. Normal tests currently employed are **[[LDH]]** and **[[MTT]]*** in known cell lines. However, it is possible to see that these tests fail to evaluate the safety of Doxil once the dosage increases. This may be due to the interaction of the nanoparticles with the colorimetric assay itself. 

This points to the need of other tools to evaluate cell viability. For example, doing morphological characterization by phase contrast microscopy, or [[high content screening]]. 

> We are confident that methods that do not include colorimetric detection can overcome identified pitfalls of the classical standardized methods when applied to toxicity assessment of nanomaterials.
