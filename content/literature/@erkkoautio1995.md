<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
The locus of industrial  innovation is shifting  toward  industrial networks,  in which parallel development processes in individual interconnected actors  frequently dominate. This development presents  new challenges for the measurement and evaluation of technology  transfer.  In  this  paper,  various technology  transfer  mechanisms and indicators are classified  and  discussed. Technology transfer  mechanisms and indicators are found to be phase, interface and component dependent. It is argued that process indicators  should be further developed to complement the picture  given by traditional  input-output indicators of technology transfer.
