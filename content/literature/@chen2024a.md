<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Efficient synthesis recipes are needed to streamline the manufacturing of complex materials and to accelerate the realization of theoretically predicted materials. Often, the solid-state synthesis of multicomponent oxides is impeded by undesired by-product phases, which can kinetically trap reactions in an incomplete non-equilibrium state. Here we report a thermodynamic strategy to navigate high-dimensional phase diagrams in search of precursors that circumvent low-energy, competing by-products, while maximizing the reaction energy to drive fast phase transformation kinetics. Using a robotic inorganic materials synthesis laboratory, we perform a large-scale experimental validation of our precursor selection principles. For a set of 35 target quaternary oxides, with chemistries representative of intercalation battery cathodes and solid-state electrolytes, our robot performs 224 reactions spanning 27 elements with 28 unique precursors, operated by 1 human experimentalist. Our predicted precursors frequently yield target materials with higher phase purity than traditional precursors. Robotic laboratories offer an exciting platform for data-driven experimental synthesis science, from which we can develop fundamental insights to guide both human and robotic chemists.
