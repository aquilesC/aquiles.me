The use of [[patents]] increases the likelihood of follow up investment by creating artificial scarcity. This has put pressure on universities to patent knowledge. In the US, there is a clear starting point: the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] of 1980. 

This means that patents may limit [[knowledge spill-over]]. 

Policies must be design to strike a balance between incentive to invest, and the diffusion of knowledge.
