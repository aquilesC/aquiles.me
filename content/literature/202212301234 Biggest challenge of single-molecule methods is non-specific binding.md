The biggest problem of single-molecule detection methods that rely on labeling specific proteins is that there will always be a "background floor" of labels that bound to the wrong protein or to the substrate. 

Non-specific binding (NSB) can be worked around by coating the substrates in such a way that there can be a washing step that limits the amount of background. However, it still poses the biggest limitation for single-molecule methods. 

Pushing the detection limit down to single-molecules (see: [[why pushing sensitivity of assays]]) is very promising, but must be done carefully. The interpretation of the results must be done carefully. 

This point is what makes the [[label-free methods]] such a relevant tool to characterize samples at low concentrations, focusing on the intrinsic properties of the analytes.
