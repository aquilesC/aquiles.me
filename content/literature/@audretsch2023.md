<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Organizational ambidexterity refers to an organization's ability to perform two tasks equally proficiently. These tasks include efficiency vs. flexibility, adaptability vs. alignment, integration vs. responsiveness, or exploration vs. exploitation. The versatility of the ambidexterity concept allows it to be used to answer multiple research questions from various perspectives. Over the last two decades, research on ambidexterity has grown exponentially, leading to significant insights into conceptualizations, determinants, consequences, operationalization metrics, sophisticated methodologies, and multiple management approaches. However, there is a research gap in technology-oriented or entrepreneurship-oriented journals that discuss multiple ambidexterity tensions or paradoxes along the innovative, entrepreneurial, and managerial process. This special issue addresses this gap by examining ambidexterity as the missing link between entrepreneurship, management, and innovation. The special issue includes five studies that reveal the intersection of tensions between entrepreneurship, innovation, and management faced by different types of organizations across the globe. These studies highlight future research opportunities and implications for different stakeholders.
