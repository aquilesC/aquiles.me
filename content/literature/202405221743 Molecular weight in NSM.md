The principle of operation of [[literature/202405221125 Nanofluidic Scattering Microscopy (NSM)|202405221125 Nanofluidic Scattering Microscopy (NSM)]] is very similar to that of the [[NanoCET]] (and the challenges are similar.) However, since they use an interferometric detection scheme, they can increase the dynamic range (in essence, the signal scatters as $d^3$ instead of $d^6$). See: [[nanoparticle tracking in hollow optical fibers]], and also see: [[increase the number of frames for tracking by confining the movement of a nanpoarticle]]. 

To prove the usefulness of the method, they focused on smaller proteins:

Two things are very interesting to note: they are able to detect dimers of proteins, since they scale linearly with molecular weight (and they prove the relationship between molecular weight and $iOC$, or interferometric optical contrast). 

On the other hand, the size distribution they get from measuring the diffusion coefficient is *very* broad (check for smaller $R$, the uncertainty in $D$ is almost 100%).
