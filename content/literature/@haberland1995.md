<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Langevin-molecular-dynamics simulations of thin-film growth by energetic cluster impact were carried out. The impact of a Mo1043 cluster on a Mo(001) surface was studied for impact energies of 0.1, 1, and 10 eV/atom using the Finnis-Sinclair many-body potential. The characteristics of the collision range from a soft touchdown at 0.1 eV/atom, over a flattening collision at 1 eV/atom, to a meteoric impact at 10 eV/atom. The highest energy impact creates a pressure of about 100 GPa in the impact zone and sends a strong shock wave into the material. The cluster temperature reaches a maximum of 596 K for 0.1 eV/atom, 1799 K for 1 eV/atom, and 6607 K for 10 eV/atom during the first ps after the touchdown. For energies of 1 and 10 eV/atom the cluster recrystallizes after 20 ps. The consecutive collision of 50 Mo1043 clusters with a Mo(001) surface at T=300 K was simulated for the three impact energies. The formation of a porous film is calculated for clusters impinging with low kinetic energy, while for the clusters with the highest energy a dense mirrorlike film is obtained, in good agreement with experiment.
