Abstract
            Microplastics are of rising health concerns because they have been detected even in remote and pristine environments, from the Artic snow to the Marianne Trench. The occurrence and impact of nanoplastics in ecosystems is almost unknown, in particular due to analytical limitations such as very small sizes that fall below detection limits of current techniques. Here we take advantage of a common interference in analytical flow cytometry to develop a method for the quantification of the number of plastic particles in the 0.6–15 µm size range. Plastic particles are stained with the lipophilic dye Nile-Red then detected by flow cytometry, a method regularly used in biology for rapid quantification of fluorescent cells. We found that sample analysis lasts 90 s, which is hundreds of times faster than the analysis of filter portions by micro-Raman and other spectroscopic techniques. Our method is highly efficient in detecting polyethylene, with staining efficiency higher than 70% and signal linearity with concentration. Staining efficiency up to 96% was observed for polyvinylchloride and for polystyrene.
