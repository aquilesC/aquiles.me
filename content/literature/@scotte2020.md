We report a line-scanning imaging modality of compressive Raman technology with a single-pixel detector. The spatial information along the illumination line is encoded onto one axis of a digital micromirror device, while spectral coding masks are applied along the orthogonal direction. We demonstrate imaging and classification of three different chemical species.
