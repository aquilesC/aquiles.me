> If we have a 3000 amino acid protein with a known sequence [...] there are errors that occur in transcription. Cumulatively, these error rates are between one in a thousand to a few per ten thousand. With a 3000 amino acid protein this means that there will be between 0 and 3 errors *per molecule*!!!. In other words, virtually no two molecules will be identical. 

The difference between molecules is fundamental, because most analytical techniques that rely on ensemble measurements, will converge to the average (expected) value. But, for example, if the molecules happen to be enzymes, each molecule may have a slightly different rate or specificity, which is then crucial to understanding the behaviour of complex systems and patterns.
