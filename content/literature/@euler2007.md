<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
A low-cost computer-based tensile testing apparatus is described that allows a graphical display of forceâ€“extension curves during the stretching of specimens in real time. The experiment is based on a graphics tablet combined with a force sensor. It can be used in a material science laboratory to investigate elastic and plastic deformations in different materials and to model the underlying molecular mechanisms. Measurements on wires, rubber bands and spider silk are discussed in terms of energy and entropy spring models of elastic forces. Entropy springs play an important role in soft matter and underlie the intriguing mechanical properties of many biological materials.
