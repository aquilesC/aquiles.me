<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Writing your lab book is easy to put off as it never seems quite as important as splitting your cells or running that gel. I’m sure, like me, you’ve said to yourself it’s fine if I leave it for a day or maybe even a week, as I’ve got all my notes to work from. However it’s easy for that to turn into a month or more and before you know it you’re sitting with a pile of scribbled notes on odd bits of paper and tissue trying to figure out just how you did that experiment 6 weeks ago.
