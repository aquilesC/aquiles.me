<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Having a well-crafted purpose statement really matters. Not only does it represent the organizationâ€™s aspirations, it also sends signals to employees about what the company stands for. It is the vital first step on the road to actually embedding and activating an authentic purpose. Yet leaders often struggle to articulate an appropriate and inspiring purpose statement due to a lack of guidance concerning the focus, scope, and form of expression they should aim for. The authors conducted a detailed analysis of purpose statements from leading organizations around the world and developed a diagnostic framework leaders can use to help craft the best purpose statement for their specific situation.
