<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Since the development of the first chemoresistive metal oxide based gas sensors, transducers with innovative properties have been prepared by a variety of wet- and dry-deposition methods. Among these, direct assembly of nanostructured films from the gas phase promises simple fabrication and control and with the appropriate synthesis and deposition methods nm to Î¼m thick films, can be prepared. Dense structures are achieved by tuning chemical or vapor deposition methods whereas particulate films are obtained by deposition of airborne, mono- or polydisperse, aggregated or agglomerated nanoparticles. Innovative materials in non-equilibrium or sub-stoichiometric states are captured by rapid cooling during their synthesis. This Review presents some of the most common chemical and vapor-deposition methods for the synthesis of semiconductor metal oxide based detectors for chemical gas sensors. In addition, the synthesis of highly porous films by novel aerosol methods is discussed. A direct comparison of structural and chemical properties with sensing performance is given.
