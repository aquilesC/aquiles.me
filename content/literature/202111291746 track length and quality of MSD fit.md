The mean squared displacement of a particle’s trajectory can be useful to calculate its diffusion coefficient. 

$$\textrm{MSD}(\tau) = 4\tilde{\textrm{D}}\tau^\alpha$$ 

Can be used to extract the diffusion coefficient. Longer tracks should yield more accurate results, but the impact on track length is hard to quantify. Therefore, if the same particle is tracked over $$10^5$$ frames, it is possible to split the data into smaller datasets and study the impact on accuracy depending on the number of frames acquired.
