Before starting a new venture, one must set a bar of how much can be sacrificed. Sometimes it can be in the form of money (i.e. how much am I committing into the project), but can also be time, career, and *opportunity costs*. It could be renamed as *affordable cost* instead of loss. In any case, the bar we set at the beginning should never be crossed.
