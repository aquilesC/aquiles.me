<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy has transformed our ability to visualize and quantitatively measure biological processes rapidly and over long time periods. In this review, we discuss current and future developments in light-sheet fluorescence microscopy that we expect to further expand its capabilities. This includes smart and adaptive imaging schemes to overcome traditional imaging trade-offs, i.e., spatiotemporal resolution, field of view and sample health. In smart microscopy, a microscope will autonomously decide where, when, what and how to image. We further assess how image restoration techniques provide avenues to overcome these tradeoffs and how “open top” light-sheet microscopes may enable multi-modal imaging with high throughput. As such, we predict that light-sheet microscopy will fulfill an important role in biomedical and clinical imaging in the future.
