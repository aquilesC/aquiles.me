The earliest method to get single-molecule data is to interrogate a very small volume. For example, if we consider a $1\mu m^3=1\,\textrm{fl}$ volume with only one molecule inside, we get a concentration of $100\, \textrm{nM}$. However, at a concentration of $1\ \textrm{fM}$, we have 600 molecules per $10^9$ femto-liter volumes. 

Therefore, flow-methods (like [[Flow Cytometry]]) operate a concentration regimes close to pico-molar: concentrated enough to detect a statistically significant number of molecules, and diluted enough to neglect coincidental detections (known as [[swarming]] in flow cytometers). 

Low concentrations are important, for example see: [[literature/202212291643 Errors in amino acid sequences]], [[why pushing sensitivity of assays]]. 

- Many methods rely on pre-concentration steps, to limit the volume that must be scanned. Examples:
    - [[Simoa]]
    - [[Erenna]]

- Some methods are truly single-molecule sensitive:
    - [[Zero-mode waveguide]]
