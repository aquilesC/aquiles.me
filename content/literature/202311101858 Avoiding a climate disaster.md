There are very interesting insights in how [[Bill Gates]] thinks climate disaster can be avoided. It goes from technology innovations, to policy changes with, to my opinion, a very realistic perception of the world. It is heavily centered around the US, which is a pity given the global scale of the problem. 

The core message is: **We need to get to net zero** by 2050. There is no way in which suffering will not be catastrophic. And with that timeline in mind, he drills down on different aspects. 

Today, [[we emit 51 billion tons of CO2]]. Therefore, whatever project we come across, we must ask ourselves, what percentage of those 51 billion are we talking about. It is crucial, therefore, [[Identifying the biggest solutions]], since resources are limited. 

There's also a very interesting breakdown table to compare what activities emit the most: 

|  Activity    |  Contribution     |
|:-----|:-----|
| Making things             |  31%    |
| Electricity               |  27%    |
| Growing Things            |  19%    |
| Getting Around            |  16%    |
| Keeping Warm and Cool     |   7%    |

This means that no single solution will address the issue fully. There must be a combination of things, from making cement and steel to finding ways of growing food without emissions. 

Importantly, it introduces the concept of [[green premiums]], meaning the extra cost that it would have to convert something from a CO2 emitting process to a net-zero one. Parsing things from this economic perspective, helps lay out plans, also for policy making.
