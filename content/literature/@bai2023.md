<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
An apparatus for biomolecule analysis, comprising a plurality of cells (1) comprising a well (10) extending along the axis (X) from a top surface (4) towards a bottom surface (2), a molecule (24) anchored to the bottom surface (2) and a bead (22) within the well; an electrically conductive solution filling the well (10); a top electrode (14) and bottom electrode (18) at the bottom surface (2) in contact with the electrically conductive solution, wherein a cavity (20) wider than the well (10) is arranged between the bottom electrode (18) and the well (10), said cavity (20) in fluid communication with the well (10) and exposing the bottom electrode (18) at the bottom surface to the electrically conductive solution filling the cavity (20).
