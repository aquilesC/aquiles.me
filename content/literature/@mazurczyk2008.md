In the context of biochips, the novel concept of a fast prototyping platform with application to surface chemistry studies is presented. Microreactors are fabricated in microscope glass slides, allowing for parallel screening. Both, the use of low-cost soda-lime glass and simplified, yet effective, method of masking render our approach affordable and flexible—which are two essential features of fast prototyping. The fabrication process is based on the deep etching of soda-lime glass slides. A photoresist/Cr bi-layer was used as a mask in order to support the deep etching of glass. A buffered oxide etchant/hydrochloric acid mixture was employed as an etching reagent, and etching conditions, namely composition and temperature, were optimised. Structures with depths exceeding 100μm and surface roughness below 10nm were obtained. The application of the devices for oligopeptide immobilisation is demonstrated.
