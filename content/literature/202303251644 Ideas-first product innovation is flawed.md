According to to the [[literature/202303251644 Jobs to be done framework]] [@ulwick], creating new products starting with brainstorming ideas is a flawed approach. The rationale is that customers need to perform so many tasks, that the chances of getting an idea that addresses several of the under-served outcomes is almost non-existing. 

Much effort has been put in validating ideas quickly (see: [[idea validation]] and [[experiments for idea validation]]), as proposed by [[lean methodology]] for startups. But validating ideas comes at an immense cost, and it may be one of the reasons why [[since most startups fail, there's a large number of false positive observations]] (also: [[product market fit with biased data]]). 

There are many "big names" that propose the approach of "*fail fast*" in order to iterate as quickly as possible on your products. However, there must be a better approach.
