<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Spectrally encoded flow cytometry (SEFC) is a promising technique for noninvasive in vivo microscopy of blood cells. Here, we introduce a novel SEFC system for label-free confocal imaging of blood cells flowing at velocities of up to 10&#x2009;&#x2009;mm/s within 65&#xA0;&#x3BC;m-diameter vessels. The new system employs interferometric Fourier-domain detection and a high-speed wavelength-swept source, allowing 100&#xA0;kHz line rate, sufficient for sampling the rapidly flowing cells 80&#xA0;&#x3BC;m below the tissue surface. The large data sets obtained by this technique would improve diagnosis accuracy, reduce imaging time, and open new possibilities for noninvasive monitoring of blood in patients.
