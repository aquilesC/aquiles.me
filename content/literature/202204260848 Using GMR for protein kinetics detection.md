Studying protein dynamics is crucial for many aspects of biology, from DNA hybridization, antigen-antibody binding, and DNA-protein interaction. However, one of the challenges is that the introduction of labels alter the behavior of the studied object (for instance, the diffusion coefficient changes, etc.)

The paper by [@gaster2011] focuses on using [[magnetic nanoparticles]] in combination with [[giant magnetic resistance]] sensors. A functionalized surface can trap the magnetic beads and their presence can be detected in parallel, in **real-time**.

The core message of the work is the development of a model to characterize the protein dynamics between labeled objects and a surface. The model is semi-analytical and seems to describe properly the detected signals. 

The biggest advantage over [[surface plasmon resonance]] sensors is the large dynamic range (6 log or more compared to 2 log for SPR), and the concentration: $$25\textrm{ng}\,\textrm{ml}^-1$$ versus $$1\textrm{pg}\,\textrm{ml}^-1$$.

This work opens the door to profiling the affinity of specific compounds against an entire proteome. 

There is a spinout associated with the project called [[Flux Biosciences]]
