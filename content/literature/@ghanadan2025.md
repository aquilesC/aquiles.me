- title: Not Buying It: The Art of Selling to Scientists, Doctors, and Other Professional Skeptics
- authors: Hamid Ghanadan
- year: 2025

Complementary reading to [[catalytic experiences]] ([@ghanadan2016])

The book is mostly focused on experiences around life science companies, but I believe they can be easily extrapolated to other contexts where highly technical people have to make purchasing decisions. I am not sure, though, this can be extrapolated to an industrial setting (machines for production, for example).
