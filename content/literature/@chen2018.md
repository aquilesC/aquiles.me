<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Malaria remains a global health challenge, especially in the developing world. Early diagnosis of malaria infected population in low-resource areas is of great interest and need, while the cost the reliability of the current methods is still a fundamental concern. Here, we demonstrated a portable optical diagnostic system (PODS) for malaria screening by detecting the malaria pigment, hemozoin. Detection limits of &lt;0.0081 pg/mL are achieved with Î²-hematin (a hemozoin mimic) in whole rabbit blood.
