# Literature Notes

These are notes taken directly from things Iâ€™ve read, seen, or heard. The core principle is that these notes are written within the context in which they were triggered, and not with a personal context in mind. 

Sometimes we may be exposed to contradicting information from different sources, and it must be in a synthesis opportunity that these views are weighed. This process frees the mind when deciding how to place notes in the organizational landscape.
