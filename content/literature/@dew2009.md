<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Ideal for a study of entrepreneurship as a phenomenon, this note                        explores the difference between causal models and effectuation. Whereas                        causal models focus on maximizing returns by selecting optimal strategies,                        effectuation begins with a determination of how much one is willing to lose                        and leveraging limited means in creative ways to generate new ends as well                        as new means. The effectuator then uses the very process of building the                        venture to bring other stakeholders on board and creatively leverages slack                        resources available in the world. At each stage of the process he or she                        chooses options that create more options in the future.
