<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Three-dimensional (3D) printing of silica glass is dominated by techniques that rely on traditional particle sintering. At the nanoscale, this limits their adoption within microsystem technology, which prevents technological breakthroughs. We introduce the sinterless, two-photon polymerization 3D printing of free-form fused silica nanostructures from a polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) resin. Contrary to particle-loaded sacrificial binders, our POSS resin itself constitutes a continuous silicon-oxygen molecular network that forms transparent fused silica at only 650°C. This temperature is 500°C lower than the sintering temperatures for fusing discrete silica particles to a continuum, which brings silica 3D printing below the melting points of essential microsystem materials. Simultaneously, we achieve a fourfold resolution enhancement, which enables visible light nanophotonics. By demonstrating excellent optical quality, mechanical resilience, ease of processing, and coverable size scale, our material sets a benchmark for micro– and nano–3D printing of inorganic solids.
