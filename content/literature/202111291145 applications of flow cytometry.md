The vast majority of publications on the flow cytometry technique belong to **medical** and **clinical** applications. This may be due to the appearance of commercial, robust, and versatile equipment. 

In **biotechnological applications**, the flow cytometer can be used to monitor cell cycle and RNA content. This can give information on cell-growth behavior in cell culture. To study RNA or DNA, a dye must be added, and the cell membrane must be permeabilized. A possible dye is **Sytox Green**. To measure cell growth, it is possible to study the proportion of cells synthetizing DNA. 

In the **food industry**, flow cytometers can be used for quality control, for example enumerating bacteria in milk, or Salmonella in chicken. In the **brewing industry**, it is possible to monitor changes in DNA and lipids during fermentation and storage. The parameters can then be correlated with brewing process quality. 

In different industries, flow cytometers can be valuable tools for online process control, assuming the sample preparation can be automated and plugged in series to the machines already being used.
