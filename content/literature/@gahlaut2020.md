<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Dengue is a serious global health concern especially in tropical and subtropical countries. About 2.5 billion of the world’s population is at risk for dengue infection. Early diagnosis is the key to prevent the deterioration of health of the patient to severe illness. Laboratory diagnosis of dengue is essential for providing appropriate supportive treatment to dengue patients with febrile illness, which is difficult to diagnose clinically. Here, we demonstrate surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based diagnosis of dengue virus in clinical blood samples collected from total of 102 subjects. All of the samples were well characterized by conventional NS1 antigen and IgM antibody ELISA kits. The silver nanorods array fabricated by glancing angle deposition technique were employed as SERS substrates. A small amount of patient blood serum (5 μL) was taken for analysis and the report was prepared within a minute. SERS spectra of pure NS1 protein as well as spiked in serum was also recorded separately. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed as the statistical tool to differentiate dengue positive, dengue negative, and healthy subjects on the basis of their respective SERS spectra. This method provides a sensitive, rapid, and field deployable diagnosis of dengue at the early stage (within 5 days of the onset of symptoms).
