<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
Bimetallic nanocomposites and nanoparticles have received tremendous interest recently because they often exhibit better properties than single-component materials. Improved electron transfer rates and the synergistic interactions between individual metals are two of the most beneficial attributes of these materials. In this review, we focus on bimetallic nanoporous gold (NPG) because of its importance in the field of electrochemical sensing coupled with the ease with which it can be made. NPG is a particularly important scaffold because of its unique properties, including biofouling resistance and ease of modification. In this review, several different methods to synthesize NPG, along with varying modification approaches are described. These include the use of ternary alloys, immersion–reduction (chemical, electrochemical, hybrid), co-electrodeposition–annealing, and under-potential deposition coupled with surface-limited redox replacement of NPG with different metal nanoparticles (e.g., Pt, Cu, Pd, Ni, Co, Fe, etc.). The review also describes the importance of fully characterizing these bimetallic nanocomposites and critically analyzing their structure, surface morphology, surface composition, and application in electrochemical sensing of chemical and biochemical species. The authors attempt to highlight the most recent and advanced techniques for designing non-enzymatic bimetallic electrochemical nanosensors. The review opens up a window for readers to obtain detailed knowledge about the formation and structure of bimetallic electrodes and their applications in electrochemical sensing.
