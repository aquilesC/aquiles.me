>CNC milling, they are common in most countries and, therefore, suitable to local fabrication through local services. 

I think there is a bit of a problem in the boundary between DIY and open-hardware. A well-documented paper should fall in the category of DIY. For example, the microscope I used during [[my phd]] was home-built and documented, but didn't use a Raspberry Pi nor an Arduino (two conditions for a paper to appear as DIY). Therefore, in the overlap of "maker" and "lab setting", there's still a lot of space to define what is "open", what is reproducible, etc. (see: [[reproducibility is the key factor of open science]]).
