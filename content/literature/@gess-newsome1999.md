<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->
ConclusionIt should be noted that the authors in this volume represent neither of the continuum extremes presented in the previous section. However, each author started with Shulman’s model and, based on their interpretation, shaped the model in unique ways that fit their perceptions of the data on teacher cognition. Hopefully this book will enhance the reader’s understanding of PCK through an analysis of both historic and current conceptions, an overview of the research literature, and a presentation of the practical implications derived from this model. Does the construct of PCK help or constrain our pursuit of excellence in teacher preparation? The answer to this question is left to the reader. An anticipated result of such contemplation will lead to individual and community exploration, development, and evaluation of alternative models used to study teacher cognition. As with PCK, future models will need to address the following questions: What knowledge do teachers need to possess in order to be effective? What model of teacher knowledge best explains the data that exists and stimulates future attempts to reconcile, synthesize, and expand our knowledge?Regardless of future evaluation, the explication of PCK as a construct and a model has reintroduced the importance of content knowledge into the teaching equation, promoted renewed vigor in the subject-specific teaching areas such as science education, and highlighted the need for integration of the various domains of knowledge in research, teaching, and teacher preparation. Using these criteria, PCK has proven to be an especially fruitful model.
