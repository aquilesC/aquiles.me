# Risk
My own definition of *risk*:

> The perceived probability of an outcome not being the desired one, leading to a success of events with variable impact on life, work, money.

[[NASA]] defines risk as[^1]:

> The potential for performance shortfalls which may be realized in the future respect to achieving explicitly established and stated performance requirements. 

Associated [[podcast]]: [[Radio Hour]], [Risk](https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/774089216/risk?t=1588508817751)

Most significant part is the discussion with [[Mariana Mazzucato]] about who is taking the risk in [[innovation]]. Are public entities offsetting the risk in order to make few people very wealthy? How does the system work to make them pay back what they have received for free?
