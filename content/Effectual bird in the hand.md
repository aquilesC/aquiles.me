In [[effectuation theory for entrepreneurs]], the idea of the bird in the hand relates to understanding who am I and what I have[@ianuzzi2017] and defining what can be achieved with what I currently posses. There are three main ingredients:

- Identity (Who am I?)
- Knowledge
- Network

Particularly, for [[scipreneurs]], the reflection can go as follows[@ianuzzi2017]

- A PI has a strong position in a specific niche, which grants them access to a pool of early adopters of a technology. Therefore, identifying *who* in the sense of how other perceive *me*. The knowledge comes from the niche in which research is done, and the network is obvious. 

One of the advantages of academic entrepreneurship (for PI's: see: [[entrepreneurship for a PI is very different than for a PhD or postdoc]]) is that the time allocation to different tasks is very flexibly. Pursuing entrepreneurial paths could be arranged without sacrificing too much personal time. This is radically different from corporate entrepreneurs.
