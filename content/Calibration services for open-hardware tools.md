A possible [[open hardware business model]] is to offer calibration services[@pearce2017]. For example, even if the design of a tool is open, there can still be value in certifying its accuracy. Non-open processes, trademarks, etc. all build into this direction. Even if the device can be cloned, one still keeps the key of the certification. This is an intermediate approach to [[artificially generated scarcity]]. 

This practice is not exclusive of open hardware, though. See: [[How Phillips protected IP by not outsourcing key manufacturing components]]. The best part of this approach is that having a calibrated device normally is required in contexts that can afford the premium, while leaving the original openness of the project intact.
