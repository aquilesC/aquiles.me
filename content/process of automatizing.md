# Process of Automatizing
Depending how you want to judge the history of human productivity, the push for automatizing tasks is, perhaps, the most rational approach. For example, you could have a bunch of people crushing grains with rocks, or you could build a mill, either moved by water or wind. The mill would allow you to make prodigious quantities of flour, replacing the work of tens of peasants. 

Without access to electricity or modern tools, people could build pyramids (both in Egypt and in Mexico). Now, we are making new buildings at increasing rates, every day faster than before. This is mostly done thanks to automating jobs that had to be done individually, by hand, in a very time consuming fashion. Such as with the windmill. 

Once you start freeing people's time, how does that change the society in which they live?
