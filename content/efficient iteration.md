The derivative task of [[prototype development]] and [[effective feedback gathering]] is to create a loop of improvement. 

One of the challenges for many startups, is that they get stuck in the solution they have created, and they fail at seeing what customers are telling. I made that mistake with the [[NanoCET]]. I was happy with the increased resolution and thought it was a very nifty idea and that everyone should love it. 

But customers were telling me things I didn't know how to process. 
Instead of iterating on the feedback, I kept pushing forward, made the device look nice, not work differently. 

A prototype has to be built to allow iteration. Be it a website, a microscope, or a consumer device. 

That's the [[Importance of a Prototype]], the capacity of iterating. 

In some contexts, a [[minimum viable product]] may not allow for iterations (for example, if production runs require a large minimum order). And that is why it's important to have a tight loop in which [[effective feedback gathering]] is funneled back to the prototype design.
