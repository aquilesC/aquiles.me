# Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage

Keywords: [[climate change]], [[biofuel]]

Idea: Grow crops, burn them, capture the CO2, store it somewhere, somehow[^1]. However, I don't understand why not just burning oil and capturing the CO2. Using biofuels adds pressure to existing crops used for food or it requires new land to be cleared thus creating a carbon debt before even starting.
