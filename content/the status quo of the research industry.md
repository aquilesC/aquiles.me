This is what [@ioannidis2014] describes as the **status quo** of the research industry: 

- Research is an industry with over 15M people authoring papers (25M were published between 1996 and 2011)
- Results and applications are exaggerated, translation (i.e. [[technology transfer]]) is slow and inefficient
- 85% of research resources are wasted (#TODO: check reference # 5)
- Non-meritocratic practices like nepotism, sexism, unwarranted conservatism are probably widespread
- There is little experimental evidence on how peer review should be done and when (protocol-based, manuscript-based, post-publication)
- Scientific structures can be traced back to the Middle Ages (academic hierarchies) or the 17th century: professional societies, journal publishing. Is this still valid today?
