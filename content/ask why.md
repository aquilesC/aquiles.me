One of my [[2020 goals]] is to ask why more often. It is loosely related to the [[Start with Why]] book. I think that many of the things I have accomplished in the past years lacked a mindful inspection at why I was doing them. 

## A personal example
Asking why helps to identify the true drivers behind decisions and tasks. Maintaining [Python for the Lab](https://www.pythonforthelab.com) is incredibly energy and time consuming. But it also allowed me to reach the point of [[publishing a printed book]]. However, when I started the project it was a side project meant to complement the workshops I was organizing. 

Now I know that the joy I find in maintaining Python for the Lab stems from two factors: My personal image, and the teaching opportunities. Thanks to the website I have been identified as "the Python guy", which puts me in a position in which I want to be. Secondly, I find joy at thinking how to explain things in a useful way for like-minded people (mostly other scientists struggling in their labs). 

## Dropping projects with unclear why's
Another outcome of asking why is realizing that some projects are not meant to come to fruition. I started [Privalytics.io](https://www.privalytics.io) because I wanted to have a Saas-like business on the side. But this why is not motivating enough. I built the technology, the business plan. But I lacked the motivation to make it grow. It is still there, the logins are closed, and it has few users. 

If I would have asked why earlier, I would have saved some time of development and I could have focused my energies onto something else. Now I see it as a learning opportunity both on how to build, release, and market a saas-product, and how to find intrinsic motivation on the things I want to do.
