There is an interesting discussion regarding **margins**, since you can have positive gross margins and negative [[net margins]]. That means that you are selling your product above the cost of creating it, but below the overall cost of operating your company. 

Imagine you have a website and you pay 10 for hosting. You can charge 15 to each customer, and you would have a positive gross margin. However, your business expenses, such as marketing and management may exceed 5, and thus the company loses money.

The image above shows a standard cost and profit overview for [[scientific products]]. In the schematic there is not even licensing, which will chirp away the profits. I think this is something many [[scipreneurs]] get wrong. They see the price of existing devices and think they'll beat them in price, let's "democratize!". However, even if your COGS are $1/10$ of what is available in the market, your final price will be $\approx 7/10$. Not such a good deal after all.
