Remains in Bulgaria show that in the Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP), modern humans had Neanderthal ancestors as recently as 6 generations before[@hajdinjak2021]. These are individuals that lived around 46ky and 42ky before the present. 

Surprisingly, individuals that lived thousands of years apart show Neanderthal ancestors between 6 and 7 generations before. If 6 generations account for around 100 years, this should point to the continuous mixing of Neanderthals and *modern* humans. 

The amount of Neanderthal genome found on the individuals in Bacho Kiro cave is around 3.8%, which is almost exactly 

$$\frac{100}/{2^5}$$

The average fraction of Neanderthal genome in present day humans is around 1.9%. 

I wonder what is the [[role of introgression to define the percentage of modern and neanderthal genome]]. Moreover, if modern humans mixed with Neanderthals often, wouldn't it be possible to say that present day humans are descendant of both?
