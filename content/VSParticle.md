The company was founded in 2014 by a professor (Andreas Schmidt-Ott), a master student (Aaike van Vugt), and 2 more co-founders that joined 1 year later: Tobias Pfeiffer and Tobias Coppejans. 

The tech around which the company was started is [[Spark ablation]] which allows to create nanoparticles of any conductive material by creating an electric arc through them. The material vaporizes in an inert gas and slowly coalesce to form spherical particles and later aggregates. 

Around 2023 the company introduced the "NanoPrinter", as system that allows to deposit the nanoparticles onto substrates and to control the pattern with relatively good control. 

Some areas of application of the technology 

-> [[PEM Water Electrolyzers]]
-> [[gas sensing]]
-> [[Self Driving Laboratory]] for material discovery

The company received funding from [[Plural]] and [[Nordic Ninja]]. 

I joined them in January 2025 as a [[product manager]].
