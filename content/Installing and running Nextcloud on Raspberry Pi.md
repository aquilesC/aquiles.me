# Installing and running Nextcloud on Raspberry Pi
I tried running Nextcloud on a [[Raspberry Pi]] 2, but with little success. The shared USB/Network is a total bottleneck and the transfer rates are incredible low even within my own LAN. I am upgrading to a Raspberry Pi 4, with 8GB of RAM to see the impact. 

The plan: Have a simple way of mirroring the data on different computers to the raspberry, both from within my house or from outside of it. Then, backup the contents of the nextcloud folder to an offsite location, such as what I describe on [[how to backup my data]]. 

## Unanswered questions
I have data on my laptop and on an external drive. I wouldn't know how to sync the external drive only when it is connected to the computer.
