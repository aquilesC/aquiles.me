## Not all developers are computer savvy
It took me a very long time to realize that nowadays not all developers are necessary computer savvy. Not all of them understand what kind of logs do web-servers store, nor how encryption can be implemented. I even crossed blogging developers who didn't even know what an [[RSS feed]] was. 

That made me think about [[The problem with the power of web developers]], and how much they decide on the rest of their users without being conscious of the perils and responsibilities of their choices.
