This is a more "modern" approach to [[Marketing]], in which companies *passively* let users find them. A clear example is having a website findable through a search engine. When people search for keywords, they will find your offer. 

It is radically different from [[Interruption Marketing]], since you assume the customer was looking for you without knowing they were. This is one of the reasons why so many marketeers focus on search engine optimization (see: [[The role of search engines for scientific marketing]]). 

However, other paths include leveraging non-paid social media posts, blogging, etc. Invitations to public speaking (not necessarily a paid presentation at a conference). 

In the end, everything which organically shares value with your target customers and that allows them to find you. This is what [[ElveSys]] does with its collection of videos about microfluidics, for example.
