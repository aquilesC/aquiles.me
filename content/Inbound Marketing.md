This is a more "modern" approach to [[Marketing]], in which companies *passively* let users find them. A clear example is having a website findable through a search engine. When people search for keywords, they will find your offer. This is one of the reasons why marketeers stress over [[search engine optimization]]. 

It is radically different from [[Interruption Marketing]], since you assume the customer was looking for you without knowing they were. This is one of the reasons why so many marketeers focus on search engine optimization (see: [[The role of search engines for scientific marketing]]). 

Today, the [[role of AI in marketing]] is uncertain. People are using more and more LLM's to get access to information rather than search engines. Which means "ranking in ChatGPT" as opposed to "ranking on Google" may be more critical. 

Alternatives of inbound marketing include leveraging non-paid social media posts, blogging, etc. Invitations to public speaking (not necessarily a paid presentation at a conference). Keeping a newsletter, getting into a newsletter or podcast through genuine interest (not as a paid advertisement). 

In the end **inbound marketing** is everything which organically shares value with your target customers and allows them to find you.
