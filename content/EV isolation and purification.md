There are different methods that are commonly used for isolation and purification of EVs ([@ramirez-garrastacho2021]):

- [[Differential centrifugation]]
- [[ultra centrifugation]]
- [[Acoustic trapping]]
- [[size exclusion chromatography]]
- [[Nanoscale deterministic lateral-displacement pillar arrays]]


However, there tends to be a mismatch between isolation and measurement techniques[@ramirez-garrastacho2021].

The most important aspect to always keep in mind is that in any isolation or purification step there are [[extracelluar vesicle]] being lost, there is the chance of inducing a bias in the results. For instance, if the method enriches particles bigger than a given diameter, or with a minimal surface charge, or molecular composition.
