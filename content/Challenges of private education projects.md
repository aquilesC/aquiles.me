I think that [[education should level the playing field]] (see: [[Correlation between pedagogical approach and science education outputs]]). For private education projects, it poses a challenge from the day they require to generate an income from the students themselves. If there is a transfer of money from students to institutions there'll be a filter based on income, that would keep increasing the problem of inequality.  

There are different possibilities already explored: 

- Projects can be built on potential future income of students, like [LambdaSchool](https://lambdaschool.com/). This approach is not too dissimilar to student loans in which people incur into a financial debt to improve their intellectual position. 
- It is possible to create platforms that are supported via donations, such as the case of [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org/). However, living off donations may not be scalable and creates a high degree of uncertainty regarding the long-term stability of projects. 
- Selling products (even if [[Open Hardware]]) can generate revenue that helps sustain further development and exploration. This is the case of [Backyard Brains](https://backyardbrains.com/) and [Foldscope](https://www.foldscope.com/)
- Selling a subscription service, like [Knowunity](https://knowunity.de/), or [Coursera](coursera.org/) are easily valued at more than a billion dollars. However, their business model is based on either providing a commodity like a degree signed by a university, or it has a paywall to be used. Coursera (or EdX) have an innovative approach of offering free access and pay for the *official* degree. 

My biggest concern is whether there is room for alternative business models that can accommodate existing patterns. For example, a combination of selling hardware and accepting donations. Is this too different from how the school-book publishing works? Editorials are for-profits, but I do imagine people donating books. On the other hand, it is also easy to imagine the lobbying for getting a book as the official one. 

I wonder if there is room for state-level deals, for example providing solutions to an entire district, country, etc. Perhaps with income-parity pricing, which would essentially mean an effective wealth transfer from rich to poor (at least at a national level).
