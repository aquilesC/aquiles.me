Something I have seen in many pitches is the idea that the *solution* people are proposing is *unique*, in the sense that the problem remains completely unsolved. [[scipreneurs]] must learn that this is not the case. People always find solutions to the problems they had, they may just be *imperfect* solutions. 

And in that perspective, [[There is always a cost to introducing new technology]], and therefore $value > cost$ is the only way in which we can generate a successful company. However, the *cost* of switching is hard to quantify. 

The [[problem-solution cycle]] in light of this concerns remains very limiting. It's hard to build a framework that satisfies it fully, and that allows to identify valuable opportunities. 

I still believe [[jobs theory]] is a much more powerful tool when properly implemented.
