There are 4 phases for [[Customer Discovery]]:

1. Deconstruct the founders' vision into the nine parts of the [[Business Model Canvas]]
2. Conduct *experiments* to test the "problem" hypotesis
3. Test the solution, presenting the [[Value proposition]] and the [[minimum viable product]]
4. **STOP** and assess the results from the previous steps. You should have answers for all of this:
	1. Full understanding of customers' problems
	2. Confirmed the value proposition
	3. Determined that a seizable number of customers exists
	4. Learned what customers will pay for the product
	5. The resulting revenue will deliver a profitable business
