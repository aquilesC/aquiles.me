Related to [[agile development]] (can be seen as an implementation of agile)

- Function as a team, not as an individual
- Team prioritizes what to do next
- Product managers give input but don't micro-manage
- Daily check-in's to check progress
- Sprints of 1 or 2 weeks. 
- "Standups" to discuss what you are doing and will be doing. 
- Retrospectives to check what worked well and what didn't 

Hard to balance **process** and **agility**. Fine line between Check-In and micro-management. 

Results are visible only after a whole sprint has completed.
