# RSS Feeds in Digital Gardens
Even though I think [[It's a pity that RSS feeds are fading away]], and I do think blogs must implement feeds in order to keep open the possibilities of inter-connecting content, I wonder what is the role of a feed on a [[digital garden]]. In the same way I think [[comments on digital gardens]] are a topic to reflect upon, feeds do not necessarily represent what a digital garden is. 

I thought about implementing a partial feed, for example by adding only articles listed on the homepage. However, this makes the feed very partial, and creates an implicit 'write-edit-publish' cycle that I was trying to avoid (see [[lower the barrier to writing]], [[lower the barrier to publishing]]). 

Feeds, on the other hand, are a very simple way of creating [[inter-domain transclusions]]. However, I wonder whether each note should have a separated feed, so we could connect to very specific updates, perhaps with a gittish flavor. Combining this with [[webmentions]] could become an incredible powerful tool, without the need for centralizing information.
