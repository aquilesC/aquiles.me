Gender unbalance in academia can be statistically observed, but in the end it all tracks back to [[unpaid work done by women]], and independent of the country[^1]. This is especially exacerbated considering maternity, [[maternity leave]], and deadlines that do not get extended. 

However, there is evidence that shows that extending deadlines because of parenting to both men and women tend to favor the career development of men (they get more time with lower unpaid burden).
