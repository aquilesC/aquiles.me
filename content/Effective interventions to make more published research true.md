In order to make more published research true there are some interventions that can be done[@ioannidis2014] :

- Diminish biases, conflicts of interests, fragmentation and work towards transparency, collaborative research (see: [[gender diversity in academia]]). 
- Interventions to change the status quo can lead to more resources wasted, or generate collateral damage
-     What does this mean?
    > A system that focuses too much on eliminating discrimination, also eliminates the reasonable discrimination required to make wise choices.
- Build incentives for large-scale collaborative research with a strong replication culture (genetic epidemiology seems to have gone through these changes). This is somehow contradictory to the changes discussed in [[changing scientific incentives can help overcome stagnation]]
- **Replication** should be feasible by default, meaning that it has to be taken into account for the experimental design, and has to be taken into account by the research agendas of the different funding bodies. 
- **Registration** of trials and results increases transparency, but it can also trigger unwanted consequences; e.g.: bad data analysis to claim spurious effects of a drug is, perhaps, harder to combat than "good" science. But nonetheless the end goal is to increase trust and credibility of the research done. 
- **Statistical methods** must be defined upfront, and there must be training and continuous education of researchers to perform proper analysis.
