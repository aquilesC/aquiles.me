The external analysis is perhaps more useful for larger companies than for startups[@ianuzzi2017]. However, it can be important to understand the framework in order to judge future processes. The focus should be to create *sustained competitive advantage* by deploying a strategy unique to us and that competitors can't imitate. 

To realize if we can succeed, we can use the **VRInS** criteria (this refers to a *strategy* not to a *product*):

- Valuable
- Rare
- Imperfectly imitable
- Non-substitutable

Entrepreneurs, however, focus on control over prediction, and therefore are willing to move the boundary conditions (see: [[Piloting a new venture]]). Especially for [[scipreneurs]], this gives them the *first-mover* advantage[@ianuzzi2017]. However, this advantage can only be achieved in specific contexts (see: [[first-mover advantage]])



The next step in the process is to study the [[competitor landscape for new ventures]].
