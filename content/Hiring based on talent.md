One of the challenges of [[managers]] is hiring the proper people for the job. [[Entrepreneurs]] face this challenge very early on, and they are normally ill prepared for the task. Considering the [[Four insights of great managers]], the pattern that can be observed is that managers hire based on **[[talent]]**.


Most people default to checking these 4 dimensions of a candidate to make a decision: 

- **Experience**, in the sense of previous work place, and work history. 
- **Brainpower**, thinking that raw intelligence will make candidates adapt (and judged based on educational pedigree)
- **Willpower**, in which the technical part can be taught and the shear desire to success must be inherent.
