I like to call the **Fallacy of the Carbon Emitters** the argument stating that, for example, China is responsible for 30% of the world [[carbon emissions]] while the US is responsible for 15%. Living in a globalized economy, the responsibility for the emissions should be those of the end consumers of goods. 

So, if China makes toys, but those are used in the US, shouldn't it be the US responsible for the carbon footprint of the goods they use? It's easy to be a clean country, or a low power user, when you move all the dirty and power hungry industries overseas.
