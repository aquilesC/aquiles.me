There is a relationship between body mass and population density, namely:

$$d = aW^{-\frac{3}{4}}$$

Where \\(d\\) is the density, and \\(W\\) is the average body mass[@zotero-705]. 

This law is used, for example, to calculate the [[population density of T. Rex]] at any one point in time[@marshall2021].
