There is a relationship between body mass and population density, namely:

$$d = aW^{-\frac{3}{4}}$$

Where $d$ is the density, and $W$ is the average body mass[@zotero-705]. 

This law is used, for example, to calculate the [[population density of T. Rex]] at any one point in time[@marshall2021].

It must be noted that the law is a 0-order approximation. Flesh-eating mammals have a 150-fold variation in population density for species of the same body mass[@marshall2021].
