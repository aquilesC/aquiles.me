E-mails offer a great deal of security and trust between senders, but they rely on the exchange of public keys. If you reached this page is because you are looking for one of my public keys, either to verify my signature or to send me an encrypted message. 

In any case, I trust you know how to proceed, and that you already know my e-mail address. These are the public keys I currently list on this website:

- [[Dispertech E-mail Public Key]]
- [[Python for the Lab E-mail Public Key]]

You can download it directly from those links, together with some instructions on how to behave in case e-mails are not signed, or you suspect my account could have been compromised. 

If in doubt, check alternatives ways to [[contact me]]
