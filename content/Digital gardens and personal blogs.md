# Digital gardens and personal blogs
If you are writing a **personal blog**, you must define what **personal** means to you. Some people like writing about their holidays and share photos. Some like to write about their job, and give advise on how to navigate the modern workforce technocracy. Sometimes you don't yet know what you want to write about. It can also very well be that you just want to **write about anything**. 

The biggest obstacle is that if you ask around, the standard answer is:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Single-focus%20or%20multiple%20topics%20for%20a%20personal%20blog%3F" data-author="@IndieHackers" cite="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/single-focus-or-multiple-topics-for-a-personal-blog-bd605af5fe">Starting with one topic will be easier to grow an audience. That doesn't limit you from expanding in the future, but it's important that you start with one to build a solid audience and establish trust. Once that trust is established, people will follow you in other topics as well :)

And this may not fit everyone. Creativity, especially on tasks we are not familiar with, such as writing, is not a linear process. Narrowing the scope too much can only hinder our progress. However, a bunch of notes is hard to navigate for an outsider, regardless of how curated your interface is. Some thoughts contradict each other, some are incomplete. That is one of the beauties of a [[digital garden]], but is not compelling for people seeking other kinds of content.

For me however blogging is mostly <em>performative thinking</em> and less captainâ€™s log. So I am looking for a space to nurture, edit in real time and evolve my thinking.

Therefore, there is an intermediate approach, in which you can still curate your content in the same way you create blog posts, but lower the barrier to publishing. As Tom Critchlow puts it, you can find a way of [[less performative blogging]], or what I call [[a new way of blogging]]. You may start with notes (either public or not) that grow into an article. However, once you acknowledge that whatever you publish can be edited, expanded, deleted, you will also realize that the content you generate can mutate. It is still a blog, but it is also a garden. You can (and are encourage to) revisit the notes, build new links, update them. 

I do think this approach is particularly interesting for personal blogs because the personality we show online can change over time. We can be very vocal about some subjects at one moment in our lives. After learning more on some of those topics, or just maturing, our views can change. Once we embrace the flowing spirit of thoughts and writings, there won't be any need to keep a chronological log of what we were thinking about at every moment of our lives if we don't want to.

The most important objective of a personal blog, I believe, is to **be out there**. Let like-minded people connect to what you think. Help your past-self that is most likely going to be very similar to another human being out there. Single-topic blogs reflect only one aspect of your life, and miss the richness of your experiences. I am a [[Python]] developer, but I also like to think about [[user privacy online]], and [[Technology Transfer]]. So, why limit myself?
