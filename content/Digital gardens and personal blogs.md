epistemic: I started this digital garden in 2020, and have been actively thinking on how it fits within my knowledge creation strategy.

There's a fine line between a [[digital garden]] and a personal [[blog]]. I took the approach of using this space as the public counterpart of my [[note taking]] process, sometimes also related to the idea of [[learning in public]]. 

The challenge is that is messy, and hard to consume. The only way to navigate is via links and [[backlinks]], there are no categories (but there are [[tags in digital gardens]]). 

What I like about the garden, is that it nicely accommodates different topics. From books I read (fiction and non-fiction), to TV-Shows I want to remember, to general [[thinking better]] by writing down. 

I was inspired by [[Andy Matuschak]] and his split between [notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) and [blog](https://andymatuschak.org/). His may be the only digital garden I check periodically. 

When I started, I was a bit lost. There's a bulk of recommendations and approaches. The discussion back then was regarding [[breaking the chronological order]] when publishing. However, most of the projects ended up not being maintained. Very few are actually kept as digital gardens. 

In that context, [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com) has a very nice interface between notes and essays. However, most of the notes are closer to drafts than to [[notes should be concept-based|concept-based]]. However, she reached the same approach regarding [[What happens when notes become long]], and transformed them into [[essays]]. 

In my specific case, I publish the essays on a different domain, https://www.aquiles.me, and rarely edit them. Notes, on the other hand, I strive to keep them alive, reviewing them and linking them as I add more information into the graph. 

Somehow, publishing the digital garden became so easy, that struggle to see the incentive of opening Wordpress and going through a blotted interface just to get a piece of text out.
