When performing [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] measurements, there can be many different sources of error. First, it is important to distinguish that there are two methods that can be used to calculate the diffusion coefficient: 

- [[calculating diffusion coefficient from jump statistics]]
- [[Calculating diffusion coefficient from mean squared displacement data]]

The second is the one that yields the best results and is the one most widely employed. 

When measuring the average diffusion coefficient, we first must consider [[sampling error when measuring the average diffusion coefficient]] which describe how accurate is the distribution of values we obtain from a given sample. 

At a single particle level, it is important to note the [[effect of temperature on determination of error in diffusion measurements]]. However, this seems more like a systematic error than a statistical fluctuation at a single-particle level. The same applies to [[effect of vibration in diffusion coefficient determination]].

- [[literature/202111291731 mean squared displacement errors]]

It is important to consider that there may be an [[Optimal track length for MSD measurements]] as well as an [[optimal number of fitting points for MSD measurements]], which are further discussed in [@ernst2013].
