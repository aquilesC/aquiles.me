The end of the [[pleistocene]] is characterized by massive extinctions[@zotero-812] that are normally associated with human intervention in the environment. 

Islands were used as models to justify these claims. However, there is evidence that [[not all hominins drove extinctions in islands]] during the [[pleistocene]], which points to stronger climatic reasons for the extinctions[@louys2021]. 

Island and continental fauna, therefore, must be interpreted differently. Especially because there is evidence of late [[holocene]] extinctions driven by humans, meaning that there was actually a cultural change. 

Different hominins went extinct during these time, which triggers that question of the [[inherent violence of modern humans]].
