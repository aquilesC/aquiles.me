To study the mixing of homo species, we can look at the historic genetic information available and reconstruct the flow of information both geographically and in time. 

This can be used, for example, to show the [[mixing between modern humans and Neanderthals]], but the [[role of introgression to define the percentage of modern and neanderthal genome]] must be taken into account.
