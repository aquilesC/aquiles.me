This is another of the columns of the [[Business Model Canvas]], and it aims at understanding the *resources* and *capabilities* currently in possession that will allow a new venture to start. This is very similar, if not exactly the same as the [[Effectual bird in the hand]]. 

- **Resources** are things that a company *has* (they are nouns)
- **Capabilities** are things that a company *can* (they are verbs)

The internal analysis is only regarding people being part of the firm, and therefore the ideas of the [[crazy quilt around a product]] do not intersect the internal analysis.
