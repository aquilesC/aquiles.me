[[Chemiresistive gas sensors]] show some specific limitations that may be hampering their broad adoption in large contexts (like environment monitoring, wearables, etc.) 

They include: 
- Non-linear response at high gas concentrations. This implies expensive calibrations. 
- Operation instability, which reduces the limit of detection (LOD)
