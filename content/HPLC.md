High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a method to separate components in a liquid: 

A column is filled with particles and liquid is flowed through it. Different interactions between the particles and the components of the liquid will generate a separation in time as the liquid moves through the column. 

Interestingly, the properties of the column can be tuned to select for different properties (as opposed to [[size exclusion chromatography]], that can only select for size). 

HPLC in tandem with [[mass spectrometry]] is routinely used in different contexts, particularly for diagnoses.
