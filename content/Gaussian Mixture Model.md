> Gaussian mixture models are a probabilistic model for representing normally distributed subpopulations within an overall population. Mixture models in general don't require knowing which subpopulation a data point belongs to, allowing the model to learn the subpopulations automatically. Since subpopulation assignment is not known, this constitutes a form of unsupervised learning.
