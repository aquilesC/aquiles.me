Sometimes companies form an internal bound to their own ideas, that prevent them from seeing the bigger picture and identify opportunities. 

[[Refeyn]] has a long history. They develop a device based on [[iSCAT]], which is purely a scattering method. The company was founded in 2018 and has received 30M€ in investment in these years. However, they struggle to identify any applications besides "mass photometry" (albeit, they are working with [[AAV]] now). 

On the other hand, [[NanoView Biosciences]] created the [[Exoid]], which is fundamentally an iSCAT with fluorescence. Built a solution targeting the characterization of larger objects (like [[extracellular vesicles]]) and their phenotype, and was acquired by [[Unchained Labs]] after around ~25M€ investment. 

I can't really tell how the culture of both companies is. I can just tell how it looks from the outside, and it's something that has happened at [[Dispertech]] as well. 

We started as a purely scattering company with the [[NanoCET]]. We built a case around the "label-free". But after a couple of years it was clear that we were missing the point, and that's why I decided to develop the [[NanoQNT]], a purely fluorescent method. 

Listening to your customers is much more important than pushing a technology down someone's throat.
