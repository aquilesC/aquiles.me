**Talent** is extremely hard to define, but that is one of the qualities [[managers]] seek out in their employees (see: [[Hiring based on talent]]). 

One of the ways it can be defined is as a *recurring pattern of thought*. People with talent are capable of delivering with the same performance under the same conditions. However, talent can be very different even for people who have been exposed to the same stimuli.
