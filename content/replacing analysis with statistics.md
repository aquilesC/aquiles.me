I have heard more than once the discussion of whether teaching analysis is *useful* for the future, or whether we should be better off replacing it with statistics. From an utilitaristic perspective, I would agree. Statistics have been dominating the world, from elections to big data, to clinical trials, but few have the tools to understand what is going on. 

However, in the discussion most people focus on the workforce. Giving tools for people to find a job functional to the (current) status-quo. Very few ask [[why we teach science in school]]. It could be that training the workforce is enough justification, but in any case it requires much better thoughts. I am a professional physicist and still, in my daily life, I barely use all the math I've learned in high-school.
