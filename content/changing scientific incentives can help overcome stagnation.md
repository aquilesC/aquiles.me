Key problem: [[Science after WWII has stagnated]], this can be seen by the lower GDP growth in both developed and developing nations. Assuming science is responsible for increasing productivity and efficiency, lower growth means lower scientific output. 

Under this assumption, it is fair to explore possible causes for this stagnation. After WWII scientific funding shifted its approach to have a quantifiable output, which gives rise to the [[problems with citation-based metrics]]. It is possible to argue that funding itself has fueled the problem because [[citations make science conservative]], and overall there is a clear problem of [[quantifying performance using multiple measurements]]. 

In the [[lifecycle of a sicentific idea]], the [[scientific exploration and play]] has a crucial role to further extend knowledge. Therefore, if we could [[measure the exploration factor of research]] and use that metric instead of purely counting citations, we could incentivize the creative development of new ideas[@bhattacharya2020]. However, this is without acknowledging that [[quantitative performance measurements produce undesired outputs]].
