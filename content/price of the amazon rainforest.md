# The Price of the Amazon Rainforest
One proposed method for [[mitigation of climate change]] is [[reforestation]]. However, any effort is futile if we don't stop first the [[deforestation]]. The [[Amazon Rainforest]] sits 2/3 in just one country: [[Brazil]]. Is it possible, therefore, to incentivize Brazilians to stop deforesting for cattle and other economical activities in order to preserve what is left? 

The free-market approach to any problem is throwing money at it. How much would a farmer/rancher need to keep the trees. The simple math would be: how much money does a rancher make a year per hectare and pay them that. It's free money in exchange of no work, so it seems to compensate[^1] . This math would give Brazil around 1 or 2 billion dollars a year. 

Now, if Brazil produces less food, overall food prices will go up, benefiting farmers in other countries. Are, therefore, values set for the Amazon farmers constantly updating to, say, US farmer rates? 

**Who pays for it?**

However, the value of the Amazon is not just for the money it makes, it's also for the [[carbon]] it holds. If we put a price on [[carbon emissions]], the Amazon would have a negative impact and thus the math is very different. The Brazilian government estimates between 10 and 20 billion dollars a year. In such situation, who pays is clearer: whoever emits pays whoever has a negative offset. But this [[carbon tax]] has proven to be very elusive in recent years.
