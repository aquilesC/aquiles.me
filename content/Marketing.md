Marketing is the process by which you raise awareness on your offering (see: [[levels of awareness for marketing]]). Marketing is not *sales*, it's what happens before. How to get someone to go through all the different layers in order to enter into the sales process. 

Some people see it as a *funnel*, but for [[scipreneurs]], [[the traditional marketing funnel]] may not be applicable, and it may be better to focus on [[catalytic experiences]].
