Once the [[Customer Discovery]] phase is complete (if it can ever be truly complete), we need to validate whether the insights we have can *scale*. Scale in the sense that the same product and the same pitch can be used again and again to different customers. 

- Is there a set of customers that will buy?
- Is the product acceptable to customers? 
- Is there serious, measurable purchase intent? 

Here we really move from [[minimum viable prototype]] to [[minimum viable product]], and validate our [[business model]] in its integrity. Do we have the distribution channels we need, do we have the partners necessary to support the product, etc. 

We need to find *answers* to these questions, we don't need to have them to get *into* customer validation. 

Which brings us to the next phase of [[Customer Creation]]
