This is one of the reasons why tools like [[Elisa tests]] will never work at low concentrations. The same is true for [[iSCAT]], for example, which requires binding/unbinding to a substrate in order to measure *optical-*mass. 

One way of overcoming the challenge of the binding to a surface is to use beads diffusing in a solution, coated to a capturing antibody. This is what [[Simoa]] does, for example.
