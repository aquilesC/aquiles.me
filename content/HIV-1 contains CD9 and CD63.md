Although [[CD9]] and [[CD63]] are used to detect [[extracelluar vesicle]], they are also present in viruses that use outward budding from host cell membrane to form their envelope[@duijvesz2015a]. Such is the case of the [[HIV]]-1 virus. 

During the infection, there can be a change in the small [[EV]] composition[@martinjaular2021], but the most important challenge is that the nascent viral particle is similar to EV composition, size, and physical features. Therefore [[it is challenging to distinguish HIV viruses from EVs]]. 

One path forward could be to perform a [[proteomeic profile of EVs]] in order to study difference at a protein level.
