One of the challenges I had regarding the implementation of the [[Luhmann method]] as described on [[How to Take Smart Notes - Sönke Ahrens]], is that it gives no room to discuss against (or in favor) of what is read. 

The book of Sönke Ahrens gives the same status to any input we consume: everything we read can become a note, and we can build knowledge on top of it. 

However, this approach creates too many biases. How can we fight [[confirmation bias]]? Anything that does not fit our established system of beliefs will not enter our [[note taking]] system. 

And I have seen the same in everyone else's discussions on notes. 

In the same way I am contesting the content of "How to Take Smart Notes" on this note, I may find a different source that explains how to overcome the challenges, but lacks something else. 

I am trying to address these challenges by creating a specific type of note called [[Literature Notes]], which are created from single-sources and give me freedom to add personal discussions. They are less atomic than most of my [[evergreen notes]], but they allow me to express my opinion and my own context at the time of writing.
