The crucial limitation of fluorescence labeling for quantification purposes is that it is almost impossible to have a 100% efficient process. 

If we want to quantify the number of a given antibody on the surface of a membrane, we could attempt to do single-molecule fluorescence detection, and assuming each antibody is uniquely labelled. 

This is the challenge which is pervasive in the use of [[Flow Cytometry]] to determine [[loading ratio of nanoparticles]] (see: [[literature/202111301443 determining drug loading and release kinetics in nanoparticles|202111301443 determining drug loading and release kinetics in nanoparticles]]) or to properly identify particles with low numbers of labeling sites. 

Another problem is the separating the signal from the background generated by the [[fluorescence arising from dye aggregates]].
