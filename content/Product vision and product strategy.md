There are two aspects that [[product-led]] companies need to master: product vision, meaning the future (for hardware companies that can be 5~10 years in the future). In big companies, there may be an overarching vision, but each product specifically will be slightly different (even if aligned). 

On the other hand, there is the *strategy*, which relates a bit more closely to the steps that the teams need to take in order to execute on the vision, and what it takes to deliver on it. 

Somehow this is related to [[OKR]] (see: [[OKR for product management]]). Just that at different time scales and without accountability. 

The important thing is that a clear product vision is a powerful tool to hiring the best professionals.
