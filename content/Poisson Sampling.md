> In survey methodology, Poisson sampling (sometimes denoted as PO sampling ) is a sampling process where each element of the population is subjected to an independent Bernoulli trial which determines whether the element becomes part of the sample.

> Each element of the population may have a different probability of being included in the sample ($\pi_i$). The probability of being included in a sample during the drawing of a single sample is denoted as the first-order inclusion probability of that element ( $p_{i}$). If all first-order inclusion probabilities are equal, Poisson sampling becomes equivalent to Bernoulli sampling, which can therefore be considered to be a special case of Poisson sampling.
