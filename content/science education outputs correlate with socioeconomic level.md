If there is a correlation between the education output and the socioeconomic level of the student, it means that the idea of [[education allows upwards social mobility]] does not hold. In Latin America's primary education, at least when judging the [[basic competences that define scientific literacy]], this is the case [@furman2020] and can be seen in the figure:

![Correlation between science education proficiency and socioeconomic level of the school in Latin America](/images/correlation_education_socieconomic_level.png)

The plot shows the mean results per school. This is problematic, since it neglects the intra-school variation, but can still provide some valuable insights. Besides the correlation between socioeconomic index and educational level. It is important to note that the spread is very large. Many schools that belong to lower socioeconomic regions can outperform schools in richer districts. 

The data is global for several countries in Latin America, a region of the world with its own challenges. Although averages may be a good starting point to understand the reality, the true value lies in the spread. What are the true underlying factors that allow schools to be so far away from the linear correlation?

Although confusing, the figure above[@furman2020] tries to show that the variation of education output within schools is much larger than the variation between schools of the same country. It is my understanding that the figure tries to show that the variation of outputs does not correlate with socioeconomic level when studied at a single-school level (orange bars) but it does correlate when looking globally.
