In the process of tuning a business model idea, entrepreneurs go through a series of processes, that are broadly referred to as *experiments* (see: [[experiments for idea validation]]). The statistics show that the majority of startups fail during their initial years, which should indicate that those experiments have a large number of false positive observations. 

In order to reduce those false positives, it is possible to apply the scientific method a bit more strictly (see: [[literature/202201061619 Treating a business model as a scientific model]]). False positives may be related to biases ([[confirmation bias]], for example), or to poorly defined objectives and metrics to measure the success of an experiment. 

I have struggled with [[establishing thresholds for idea validation]]. Perhaps being overly optimistic regarding the meaning of the results is a common treat of entrepreneurs.
