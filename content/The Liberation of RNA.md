# The liberation of RNA (podcast)

[[Radiolab]] [[podcast]] episode, telling the story of [[Brandon Ogbunu]], who is now an assistant professor somewhere in the US. It is a mixed of a recorded storytelling episode and an interview. What struck me the most is the powerless feeling of being shook down by police, *just because*. This is not an exclusively US phenomenon, each country has its fair share of racism and prejudice. 

At some point he discusses about [[James Watson]], and discovers that he is his scientific grandson. Indeed an incredibly powerful image to have on ones mind while listening to Brandon talking. One of the things that I've seen repeated over and over, is this idea that because he belongs to a minority, he must spend a lot of energy and time fighting against injustice, which in turn exacerbates the problems of under represented groups. I've heard the same argument on a [[climate change]] podcast.
