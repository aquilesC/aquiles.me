There is a discrepancy between measurements based on [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] and the [[EVQuant]] protocol[@hartjes2020]. (See: [[quantifying the concentration of EVs in urine or plasma through confocal microscopy]]) 

The [[NanoSight]] is not a reliable instrument for small particles, given that they diffuse very quickly (see: [[Sources of error in measuring Brownian Motion]]). On the other hand, if the samples are immobilized and imaged through a confocal microscope, it is possible to adjust the settings to become sensitive even to single-molecules.
