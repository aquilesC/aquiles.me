Mitovescicles are a new type of [[extracelluar vesicle]] that derive from mitochondria[@dacunzo2021]. It has been known that vesicles sometimes encapsulate other bodies, but only recently has been found that some vesicles can be generated by smaller organelles inside cells. 

In order to identify them, in the paper [@dacunzo2021] the authors used high resolution density gradients. Bear in mind that particles have similar sizes, therefore density proved to be the only path to discriminating between them.

[[Nanoparticle tracking analysis]] (Particle Metrix) allows to characterize the amount of particles in each fraction resulting from the density gradient separation. 

One of the most important observations is that **EVs can be reproducibly separated based on density** (see: [[Separating EVs based on density]]).
