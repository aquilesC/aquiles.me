Considering that women make half the world population, can they be considered a minority? If we would normalize by the power each group exerts, it is possible to consider women a minority assuming men have more power. However, putting women in the *minority* class risks the naturalization of the [[gender unbalance]] in any context. 

See, for example, this tweet by Said Rodriguez:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are talking about scientific conferences. I don&#39;t know in your field, but in every physics/photonics conference I&#39;ve been, women were a minority.</p>&mdash; Said R. K. Rodriguez (@srk_rodriguez) <a href="https://twitter.com/srk_rodriguez/status/1331873900905582594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

No doubts in a male-dominated environment such as physics, researchers will exert their own power to keep the playing field tilted in their own advantage (see: [[The problem with people in positions of power in academia]]). Claiming that women are a minority means that there won't be an extra effort to give women their rightful place, especially considering the [[unpaid work done by women]] and the [[Work policies designed for the average]]. 

One of the biggest challenges is that most of these researchers actively believe they are being *fair*. They do believe that they are doing the proper math and shield themselves behind statistics. They almost invariably reach this conclusion: "If there are 10 women and 100 men, then in a conference there should be 10% female speakers." 

They never consider, for example, that an alternative approach would be to [[limit the number of male speakers in conferences]], not the number of women speakers.
