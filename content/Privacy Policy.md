## Tracking page visits without storing personal information
I started monitoring the visits to each page as of October 20, 2020. There is a short discussion on the [[about]] page. The visits are monitored by a service I wrote myself (see: [[things I've done]]), and therefore I fully own the data generated. Moreover, the system was designed to avoid recording personally identifiable information such as geo-location, IP address, or specific browser data. I don't use cookies. 

Next to my own script, I use an analytics service provided by CloudFront. This service does not store personal information. You can read more about it on [their documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics).

## Comments
Every page has a comment form that can be used to communicate directly with me or other guests. Filling the comment is completely optional. The service relies on Github to filter spam, and comments are stored as issues on the repository of this website. Comments will be associated with Github user accounts, and users are free to delete or update them at any time. 

## The newsletter
I started using [Revue to host my newsletter](https://newsletter.aquiles.me/). You can subscribe from every page. bear in mind that Revue has its own [terms](https://www.getrevue.co/terms) and [privacy policy](https://www.getrevue.co/privacy).

## Cookies
The website overall does not store any cookies on your compute.
