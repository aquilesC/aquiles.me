Many incubators push for the idea that [[scipreneurs]] need someone with business experience to get started. Many scipreneurs actually believe it, and go out looking for more experienced people (most likely men), that overvalue their contributions to a small company. 

It's very easy to fall for the [[gray hair fallacy]]. 

If we keep in mind that [[Executives are not effectual reasoners]], the best shot an entrepreneur has is to find another entrepreneur (or at least someone *entrepreneurial*), or to build a team with the missing skills. However, the "Business Experience" will come at a cost and burden that a startup can't simply bear. 

What I believe is that [[scipreneurs need someone with whom to build]], experience is a secondary metric.
