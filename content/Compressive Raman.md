To overcome some of the limitations of [[Raman Emission]], it is possible to exploit highly sensitive light-detectors, like a Single-Photon-Avalanche-Photodetector (SPAD). However, to acquire a spectrum with a point detector, it is necessary to create a secondary scan direction in wavelength. 

This can be achieved with a moving grating that directs different parts of the spectrum to the detector, or with the use of a spatial light modulator such as a DMD array (see: [[@gentner2023]])

Another idea is to use a line excitation coupled to a line-detector (such as a SPAD array) via a diffraction grating and a DMD. In this way it is possible to perform spectroscopy in several sites in parallel. 

I wonder if there would be an application where the triggers from a [[neuromorphic detector]] can be used to optimize the information extracted from a tunable spectral filter.
