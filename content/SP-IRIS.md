Scheme of the SP-IRIS setup from [@frigerio2022] (and this [[literature/202301141333 Comparing SiMoA and SP-IRIS|note]]). 

Single-particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensing is a technique commercialized by [[NanoView Biosciences]] under the name ExoView. 

They use a [[microarray]] functionalized with specific antibodies, which trap particles. Using an interferometric detection system, they can measure the presence (and the size) of the particles at each spot. In a second labelling step (like in [[Elisa tests]]), the fluorescence signal can be measured. 

It is a form of [[Analog versus digital detection of molecules|digital detection]], with the added size-ability which is purely analog in nature. Since it is an [[interferometric detection schemes|interferometric method]], it can work at smaller sizes ([[extracellular vesicles]] down to $50nm$, for example). 

The interferometric detection seems similar to [[iSCAT]], but I haven't checked the details of the interferometric approach. 

A similar measurement approach is that of [[Simoa]], just that in that case, the analytes are trapped by beads and not just by the surface. 

Another company producing a relatively similar product is [[Myriade]], under the name [[Video Drop]]. 

The image below (from [@gori2020] and [[literature/202301141616 Membrane-binding peptides to detect small EVs]]) can give an idea of the number of particles analyzed in a single-measurement (not sure if it is representative, though)

Integrating the numbers (by eye) gives a total of around 300 particles in the histogram. 

From the same paper, this figure gives a more comprehensive overview:

The image disk is $40\,\mu m$ across, which means $1350\mu m^2$. If the total number of measured particles is $200k\textrm{pcles}/\textrm{mm}^2=0.2\textrm{pcles}/\mu\textrm{m}^2$ , gives a total of $270 \textrm{particles}$ in the field of view.
