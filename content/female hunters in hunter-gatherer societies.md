[[Gender bias]] manifest itself in many different ways, including ethnography and anthropology. In [[hunter-gatherer]] societies in the late [[pleistocene]], it was always assumed that males were in charge of hunting and females in charge of gathering. This is an extrapolation of contemporary non-industrialized societies, but it does not necessarily represent how the past was. 

Particularly in America there is enough evidence[@haas2020] that females had an active hunting role based on the number of burial sites of females with hunting tools. The presence shows a statistically significant deviation from random burials, meaning that women were buried with weapons on purpose. These burial sites are present through the continent, indicating that it was not an isolated practice.

The archaeological evidence also supports that [[egalitarian societies explain diveristy in hunter-gatherer groups]].
