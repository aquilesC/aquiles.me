Seeing the world from the perspective of the person we want to convince is very powerful, but it is also very hard. [@carnegie2010] gives some examples, for example of convincing teenagers not to make a fire close to a tree.

It is not dissimilar to [[Talk in terms of the other person's interests]]. We first make them like us, them we push our own agenda.
