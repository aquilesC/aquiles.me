A completely unrestricted process may not be what triggers creativity[^1]. By having a concrete method, it is possible to compare results. The fact of having 26 letters is limiting, but it is also freeing. However, there are many examples of creativity pushing the boundaries, for example by developing new programming languages, or by the use of neologisms instead of staying within the dictionary. 

Ahrens confuses, I believe, what are restrictions and what is methodology in research. Of course, there are many fine distinctions, for example between freedom and apathy, restrictions and limitations, etc. 

Little advice is given on how we can develop an environment that imposes restrictions but not limitations. Ahrens suggests that [[The Luhmann method]] of [[note taking]] is one of such examples, but makes no comments on how to achieve the same collectively, for example in a research group.
