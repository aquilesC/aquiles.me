Unless gender is explicitly female, most people default generics as *male*[^1]. For example, Sonic the character of videogames is not obviously female, therefore we default it as a male-character. This happens in many different contexts, but it is especially worrisome if it happens when generating scientific results. Papers that do not explicitly specify a female-population can probably be considered as derived from a male-dominated sample.
