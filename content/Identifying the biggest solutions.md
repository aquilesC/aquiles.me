I was reading [[@gates2021]] and there's a section in which he discusses that when hearing pitches of companies, a threshold to continue the conversation is how big the solution is. This happens in the context of [[climate change]] and [[reducing carbon emissions]], but the same framework can be applied to any context of [[pitching a startup]]. 

When doing [[things that can scale]], it is important to have a grasp of how much they can scale. Again, in the context of climate, where resources are scarce, a company trying to tackle around 0.1% of the problem should not be prioritized over one tackling 10% of the problem. 

This is relatively easy to do in a context with a very clearly defined metric (tonnes of $CO_2$) but perhaps not so much in other contexts. Especially when dealing with [[venture capitalists]], a metric (although very superficial) can be the [[total addressable market]]. It can be a clear proxy for people who understood the context in which they operate, and go for the most impactful solution.
