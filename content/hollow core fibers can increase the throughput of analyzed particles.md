[[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] in [[hollow core fibers]] instead of in [[hollow optical fiber]] can increase the throughput of the measured particles[@Fo2020]. However, hollow core fibers have the same problem of free diffusing particles that go out of focus or overlap each other's trajectories. On a typical experiment [@Fo2020], it is possible just 100 particles and not all of them for sufficiently long times even if they were using non-diluted samples.

Considering that in hollow optical fibers it is possible to track 100's of particles, I wonder how would a hollow core fiber would actually increase the throughput of the method beyond what free diffusion offers. See: [[limitations of nanoparticle tracking analysis]]
