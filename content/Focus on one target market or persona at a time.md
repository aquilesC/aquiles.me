Part of the [[product strategy]] should always be to address a clear market, and in this context a "market" is defined by the group of customers who share the same needs when it comes to the product specifications. 

For example, if a product targets *students*, the requirements for university, high school or elementary school are going to be different in many regards. From the distance between purchase decision maker (parent) to user (kid), to regulations, to marketing, to design. 

Perhaps the underlaying product is exactly the same, the technology is the same, but customer needs are slightly different and they must be addressed independently. If you aim too broad, you'll miss opportunities and there's a chance you'll disappoint everyone.
