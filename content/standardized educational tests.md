There are several tests, not all are universal, that try to measure the educational level of students. I am particularly interested in those that can be used to measure the [[basic competences that define scientific literacy]] and are used, for example, to determine that [[science education outputs correlate with socioeconomic level]], or that [[University students perform poorly in basic science tests]]. 

Some of these tests are: 

- PISA Tests
- TIMSS
- TERCE
- ERCE

I wonder weather using standardized tests would not induce the problems of [[measuring performance using single criteria]] or [[quantifying performance using multiple measurements]]. The contents of the exams I've seen are broad and somewhat abstract. And it is not clear to me that artificial incentives necessarily create unintended consequences.
