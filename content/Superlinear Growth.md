[[Paul Graham]] wrote about [superlinear returns](http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html) and I find it a very powerful concept. 

The idea is to focus on those activities that compound over time and that lead to a super-linear (perhaps exponential) type of accumulation. At the initial stages, numbers (of whatever you measure) are rather small and they look the same. 

[[Growth is a better indicator than quantity]] for small companies, if they have the ambition of becoming big, of course. 

If two competitors have linear growth, they may en up splitting the market half/half. If one has a super-linear growth, over time it'll capture the entire market ("winner-takes-all").

In the end, it all comes down to a mindset. What things can we do that put us in a superlinear trajectory. After all, whether we are in a superlinear path **depends on past actions**.

Growing the user-base one by one, for example, "does not scale" (see: [[essays/Do things that can scale|Do things that can scale]]), but it may generate a compounding effect. I add one user, but thanks to that, two users sign up without my intervention. I add one more user, two more users sign up plus the extra two each brought. But without that initial push, no one would have ever signed up.
