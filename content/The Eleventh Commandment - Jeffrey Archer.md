# The Eleventh Commandment - Jeffrey Archer

I found this book in the library of a camping we stayed during the [[2024 Mont Saint-Michel bike trip]]. 

It's the first time a read this type of novel, and it was definitely the kind of reading I was after for a bike trip (or to read on the beach). It's fast, you definitely want to know what happens next. It's reading on paper a story that I've seen millions of times in american spy movies. 

The trigger is clear: a CIA operative assassinates a presidential candidate in Colombia. This is done without the president knowing, ordered by the CIA director (Drexler). The operative, Fitzgerald, is somewhat of a hero: Medal of Honor in Vietnam, and an excellent professional. Although, his family has no clue what he does for a living. 

The president gets a sense of what's going on, and tries to deal with Drexler, but it backfires, so he enlists a former CIA agent to build a case agains Drexler, trying to find out what went down in Colombia. Through several maneuvers, Fitzgerald is sent to Russia, and framed. Ends up being lined up for execution, but saved last minute by the Mafya and his former colleague (whom sacrifices his life to save him). 

It's a very typical american spy novel, with assassinations and cover ups. Even the secretary of Fitzerald is killed in what is made to look like a road accident. 

In the end, it all ends well. The conspiracy of the director is uncovered and she's forced to resign (although she runs for the senate). Fitzgerald fakes his own dead and rejoins his family few months later in Australia. 

The novel has to be read for what it is: a light story with spies, intrigue, Russians, and assassins. Good summer read, not too much high literature looking at the human condition.
