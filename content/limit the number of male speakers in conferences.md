When planning a conference, there will be a forefront question: how many women should be invited to speak. Scientific conferences trade "invited speakers" as a prestige measure. Invited speakers are selected ad-hoc, which means that organizers have a natural position of power (see: [[The problem with people in positions of power in academia]]). 

People (i.e. men) like complaining about the lack of women to select from to have as candidates for being invited speakers. And therefore, instead of striving for a 50% female presence, they try to do, at best, a number of female speakers completely skewed in favor of men (see: [[women are half the population, not a minority]]). This have a very simple solution:

**LIMIT THE NUMBER OF MEN!**. 

If you only find 10 women to speak at your conference, then invite no more than 10 men. Period. I am confident that if you force this policy, organizers will find women to speak at their conferences. And if they don't (women have other things to do, you know? [[unpaid work done by women]]), just organize a smaller conference. Have fewer male speakers. Voil√†, *out-of-the-box* problem solution.
