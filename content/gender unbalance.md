title: Gender Unbalance

# Gender Unbalance
[[Gender]] is a clear indicator for unbalance in any kind of context. Assuming only two genders (OK, a bit antiquate but a good first-order approach), the population can be split in two equal halves. Therefore, any environment in which genders are not represented equally has a [[bias]]. 

**Gender does not identify a minority**, talking about women as a minority is a problem. Should be referred to as an **under-represented** group (See [[women are half the population, not a minority]])
