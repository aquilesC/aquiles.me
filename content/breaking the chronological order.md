And the damn reverse chronology bias — <em>once called into creation, it hungers eternally</em> — sought its next victim. Myspace. Facebook. Twitter. Instagram. Pinterest, of all things.

A common feature of blogging was the idea of having articles displayed in *chronological order*. This may work for someone who does a real periodic log, but not for the majority of the people who like writing about what they know, about what they learn. Even technical articles about a programming language need to be updated once in a while, or follow up content must be properly linked.

<p class="css-yw8fqx e1tutuyt0">Chronologically sorted pages of posts aren't how people actually use the internet.</p><p class="css-yw8fqx e1tutuyt0">For the most part we use search via Google to find stuff, which is free form and task oriented. You want something, you know what you want, you can string a few words together and hope to get lucky. </p>

The first thing I did when building this website (see: [[how i built this website]]) was to remove any form of ordering, and focused solely on the navigation aspects. If someone reaches a page I wrote (either because I or someone else shared it, or because Google sent them), I want to give them the possibility to keep exploring the different aspects of what I think and write. That is why I also focused on making backlinks (see: [[backlinks are the core of my digital garden]]) very visible, and there is a color distinction between internal links and external links.
