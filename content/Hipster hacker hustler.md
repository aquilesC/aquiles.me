A successful company has three types of personalities defined in their team:

- **Hipster**: Who can keep an eye on things "cool", for example product designers. 
- **Hacker**: The ones who glue technology together, and know how to make things work.
- **Hustler**: Is the one who keeps to deadlines, who organizes the team into *execution*.

The three profiles of personalities does not say anything regarding their skills. A hustler may or may not be commercially oriented, and the *hipster* may be a good developer. It says more about the personality of the founders. 

I am not sure I fully agree with this characterization of [[startup]] founders, but it seems to replicate some notable examples, such as Apple or Facebook. I believe, more importantly, [[founding teams]] need to be able to circulate as challenges keep changing in the early stages of the company formation. 

Perhaps it can be related to the [[MBTI personality indicator]].
