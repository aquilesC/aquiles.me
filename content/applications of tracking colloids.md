Tracking colloids in video is useful to study Brownian motion, phase transitions, to probe the effects of external fields on colloidal dynamics, and to measure the interaction between pairs of particles [@crocker1996]. 

This method is closely related to [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]]. See also: [[limitations of nanoparticle tracking analysis]].
