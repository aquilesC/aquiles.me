When completing the [[Phases of customer validation]], the last step is to decide whether the company will continue its current course or it needs to pivot. 

- Assemble and review all key discovery and validation findings
- Review the business model hypothesis and their interactions with one another
- Focus on the metrics that matter in the financial model 

Some red flags: 

- The company needs 100k customers to be profitable, but the market is not that large
- Customer acquisition costs are too high
- The sales roadmap is too complex, [[cost of sales]] become way too high
- Referrals are not delivering new customers
