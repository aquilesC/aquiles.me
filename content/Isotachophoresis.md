It is a method associated with [[literature/202301192057 Free Flow Electrophoresis|free flow electrophoresis]], in which the sample is introduced between a leading and trailing electrolyte solutions. During the separation, the sample is arranged based on their mobility, and they create sharp boundaries in which the concentration of analytes is constant after having been readjusted according to the concentration of the leading ion. 

This method allows both separation and concentration of the analytes. 

This is the technique implemented by [[EXIT071]] in the nanofluidic channel.
