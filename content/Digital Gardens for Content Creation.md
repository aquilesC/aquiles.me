Blogs, news articles, podcasts, they all build an interconnected network of sources that are very valuable for anybody creating content online.

I need backups not just for my files, but for the web pages I read and use—they’re all part of my exomind. It’s not much good to have an extensive essay on some topic where half the links are dead and the reader can neither verify my claims nor get context for my claims.

But we can work at different degrees of technical complexity depending on what we want to achieve and we don't need to start right away with such a sophisticated tool-chain.
