# Learning Javascript
I decided to learn JavaScript in order to be able to gain independence when building websites. So far, I have been relying too much on templates, and would like to move away from them, and develop my own custom solutions (perhaps inspired by themes and templates, but without relying on them.)

## Problems
A lot of resources focus on teaching not only the language but also about programming. I don't care about learning again what a for-loop is, since I already know this kind of things. I don't care about node.js and express.js, I already have [[Python]] and [[Django]] for that, I want to learn about front-end coding. However, resources seem to be mixed. 

## Resources
Some of the things I found or were suggested:
