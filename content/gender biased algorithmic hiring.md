Building on [[the myth of the double blind]], Criado Perez[^1] tackles the next big issue for "artificial intelligence", which is the [[recruitment bias]]. Although it could be possible to overcome the limitations (and biases) of CV-screening by a human, algorithms which are mainly done by *men* will fall pray of their own limitations. 

For example, a company call Gild, was using some indicators of programming *excellence* of candidates. Those indicators included how often people were engaging on a specific manga website. This, however, does not account for the fact that women may not have the time for such banalities (see: [[how much unpaid work is done by women]]), or may be penalized for such an anti-social behavior (see: [[expected female traits]]). 

Therefore, Gild's system *is* biased towards men but they hide behind secrecy and the absurd notion of the purity of algorithms (see: [[what are algorithms]]).
