There are 8 principles [developed by Kotter](https://www.kotterinc.com/8-steps-process-for-leading-change/) that define when a manager is unable to perform changes in the organization where they work: 

- create a sense of urgency
    - Communicate the importance of acting quickly
- build a guiding coalition
    - The coalition is born out of the organization own ranks, especially when starting, one must consider also how to [[build trust in a team]]
    - Related (loosely) to [[Crazy quilt around a product]]
- form a strategic vision and initiatives
    - Explain how the future is different from the past and what things are possible to reach there.
- enlist a volunteer army
    - Communicate your vision so that others can join. This relates to making big changes in an organization, but can also be useful to gather momentum when starting. 
- enable action by removing barriers
    - Remove silos and work across domains. Empower people to act by themselves. 
- generate short-term wins
    - Show, recognize, communicate. They are a powerful driving force. 
- sustain acceleration
    - Press harder after success. Be relentless. Be mindful of your increase in credibility to further drive changes
- institute change
    - Make the link between the new habits and the organizational success. Be sure to cement the new behavior such that it persists in the organization.
