# Substack Wants to Scoop as Much Information as They Can
I was hosting my [[newsletter]] on [[Substack]] because they were the cool new player in that domain. When they released their way of finding newsletters to follow through Twitter I gave it a try and found out this abusive set of permissions:

* See Tweets from your timeline (including protected Tweets) as well as your Lists and collections.
* See your Twitter profile information and account settings.
* See accounts you follow, mute, and block.
* Follow and unfollow accounts for you.
* Update your profile and account settings.
* Post and delete Tweets for you, and engage with Tweets posted by others (Like, un-Like, or reply to a Tweet, Retweet, etc.) for you.
* Create, manage, and delete Lists and collections for you.
* Mute, block, and report accounts for you.
* See your email address.

This was a huge down turn, and a violation of their [[user privacy online]]. I don't think their service merits such a degree of access to my data, and ultimately made me decide to cancel my subscription.
