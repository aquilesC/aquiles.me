Once you've mastered [[How to present yourself in a CV]], the next crucial element is the **cover letter**. I have seen many people falling in the same pitfalls, and thought it would be worth spending some time explaining what I would like to see in the cover letters I receive.

First, it is important to note that not in all countries cover letters are requested. In some job applications it is explicitly stated and in some they are not, so it is up to each one to judge whether you should include one or not. In my case I do want to see cover letters. People applying through LinkedIn normally fail at adding one, since they submit a generic CV. I would strongly, advice you to add one to the PDF before applying for a job. It completely changes the attitude regarding the interest in the job position. 

Cover letters are a complement to the curriculum vitae. In my case, I read the CV first and if that passes some basic thresholds, I read the cover letter. 

Cover letters, generally, must address two topics: **why me** and **why here**. Writing a good cover letter is not easy but it can get you much further than just a CV because you are in complete control of the reader. You can decide what and how to say things. Therefore you must dedicate a healthy time to think about what to write when you are applying for a job. It'll become easier later on, when most things can be almost copy/pasted. 

## Don't repeat your CV
I have seen almost all cover letters repeating the information on the CV. Sometimes with identical words. This adds very little information about the candidate and should be avoided. I already know what and when you studied, or where you worked. No need to say, again, I studied this career in this university from this year to this year. The cover letter is the chance to express yourself beyond what the history of your life shows. It is your opportunity to preemptively answer questions that may arise while scanning your curriculum. 

With that said, let's explore the things that must absolutely be covered in your letter. 

## Addressing why me
Your CV essentially tell how others perceive you. It tells the grades you got in school, or who else decided to hire you. But it tells very little about how you see yourself.
