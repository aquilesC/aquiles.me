Once you've mastered [[How to present yourself in a CV]], the next crucial element is the **cover letter**. I have seen many people falling in the same pitfalls, and thought it would be worth spending some time explaining what I would like to see in the cover letters I receive.

Not all jobs require a cover letter (or motivation letter), so it is up to each one to judge what to do. In my case I do want to see cover letters. People applying through LinkedIn normally fail at adding one because they submit a generic CV. I would strongly advice you to add one to the PDF before applying for a job. It completely changes the attitude you are transmitting regarding the interest in the job position. 

Cover letters are a complement to the curriculum vitae. In my case, I read the CV first and if that passes some basic thresholds, I read the cover letter. 

Cover letters, generally, must address two topics: **why me** and **why here**. Writing a good cover letter is not easy but it can get you much further than just a CV because you are in complete control of the reader. You can decide what and how to say things. Therefore you must dedicate a healthy time to think about what to write when you are applying for a job. It'll become easier later on, when many elements can be reused. 

## Don't repeat your CV
I have seen almost all cover letters repeating the information on the CV. Sometimes with identical words. This adds very little information about the candidate and should be avoided. I already know what and when you studied, or where you worked. No need to say, again, I studied this career in this university from this year to this year. The cover letter is the chance to express yourself beyond what the history of your life shows. It is your opportunity to preemptively answer questions that may arise while scanning your curriculum. 

With that said, let's explore the things that must absolutely be covered in your letter. 

## Addressing why me
Your CV essentially tells how others perceive you. It tells the grades you got in school, or who else decided to hire you. But it tells very little about how you see yourself. A good cover letter will show your skills, but also your passion and motivation. From a CV alone it is very hard to understand why you chose the specific path you are following. The cover letter is an ideal place to explain it. 

It is important to preemptively address issues that may be apparent from your CV. For example, if you had 5 different jobs in the last 2 years it'll made me wonder about how you chose where to work, whether you know what you want in life. If you have an answer for these concerns, answer them as soon as possible. 

Non-professional activities, such as hobbies one may have, volunteering projects, something extraordinary that you've done are important features. Do you enjoy writing and have a blog? Do you like taking photos and have an Instagram account? Not all hobbies are relevant for all jobs, but do not under estimate them. If someone has been experimenting with Arduinos or Raspberry Pi, for example, they may be a better fit than someone who has a very specialized technical background in what we do. 

## Why here

Explaining who you are and what you think is simpler. You just need to see the job description and try to determine what aspects of your personality are the most relevant for the job as you imagine it. However, addressing the why here requires a bit more of research. I've called it **why here** because it relates to how scientific proposals are structured. Perhaps it could be better called **motivation for applying**. 

This section of your cover letter is the best place to show that you have checked where you are applying and to what role. For example, most letters I've received stress how good candidates are at team playing. They completely neglect the startup nature of our company and the fact that most work is done essentially alone. Sure, we cooperate, but self-drive and determination are much more important than needing a team to succeed. 

You can address what is it about the company that made you apply. Remember that people receiving your letter are smart. Empty sentences like *I truly believe in the mission of the company*, or *I want to do something with an impact in society* are automatically ignored in my mind and, probably, I will stop paying attention since I know they are copy/pastes generics. If you, on the other hand, talk about the product, how you would improve it, about the background of the company, etc. your chances of grabbing my attention are extremely higher. 

## Avoid empty claims
The biggest advice I can give anyone writing a cover letter is that it is better to make it short than empty. In some random cases I took the time to check whether the claims they were making were true. For example, people who claim to have been using different programming languages or modeling programs, but they don't talk about either of them in their scientific papers, nor have any way of showing what they've done. 

Again, remember that the person reading your letter is a smart person. Throwing keywords one after the other is meaningless. Be mindful about the message you want to convey and do it as a grown up. You are applying for a job, this is not a high school assignment in which you can get around by filling lines of text without adding meaning. The cover letter is not only a tool to pass to the next phase, it'll also set the tone of the interview. Do it right and the interview will be on a positive tone, not on an inquiry tone. 

## Ask someone to read it
If you do care about the job, ask someone to read the cover letter for you. If you find someone in the same field, it's even better. Ask how they feel after reading it. Probably they know you, they know your personality, and can decide whether you are conveying a fair picture of yourself or if you are failing at generating a correct image. 

The most important thing to remember is that whatever they say, it's just feedback that you may or may not incorporate.
