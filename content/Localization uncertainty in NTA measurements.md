Tracking error is defined[@catipovic2013] as the uncertainty in time and position for each particle. The localization of the particle is limited by the number of photons, shot noise, etc.

It must be noted, also that [[brownian motion]] itself generates localization uncertainties[@ernst2013]. Although longer exposure times allow the collection of more light, they induce a larger uncertainty if the particles can diffuse a lot during that time window. This is quadratically problematic for small particles, since they scatter less light AND move faster. 

The *reduced localization error* can be expressed as:

$$x=\frac{\sigma^2}{D\Delta t}$$
