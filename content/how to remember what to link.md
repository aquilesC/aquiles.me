# How to Remember what to Link
I received this question more than once already. When building a [[digital garden]], how do you remember what you can [[link]] to and how. I have a very simple process. 

Each note is a file. Its name is more or less descriptive. For example, the name of the file for this note is ``how to remember what to link.md``. For [[linking]] between notes I use the double bracket notation: ``[[`` ``]]``. Therefore, if I want to link to a file called ``how I built this website.md`` I just type down ``[[how i built this website]]``. It translates to:

[[how I built this website]].

An extra feature, is that since I am using [[Obsidian]] to write the notes, every time I start a link, it will show me some suggestions based on what I type. This helps me avoid creating a link like: 

``[[how this website is built]]``

Sometimes links are single-worded, in which case it is easy to do it right. For example, I can link to the name of a program, or a very specific concept. But for general ideas, or longer sentences, then it can become slightly more complicated. 

I have seen what [[Andy Matuschak]] does in his [notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), and I can tell that a lot happens because of him remembering that he already wrote something down and forces the link to those notes. 

## This Is Work In Progress
[[How to build links between notes]] is still [[working in progress]]. At this stage I was focusing more on creating a base set of knowledge notes and an emergent [[taxonomy]], and can revisit the status later.
