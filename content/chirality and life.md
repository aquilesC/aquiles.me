Organic molecules have the same chirality, which points to the idea of a single origin of life. 

If chirality does not alter functionality, cells would not prefer one over the other, etc. 

This also means that the enantiope(?) would be immune to enzimes, making those molecules ideal candidates for plenty of things without neglecting all the known biology and chemistry. 

Moreover, this could be a great starting point for a sci-fi novel
