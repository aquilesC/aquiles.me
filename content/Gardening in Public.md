The entire purpose of [[This website is not a blog|this website]] was to [[lower the barrier to writing]] and, especially, [[lower the barrier to publishing]]. 

In the end, I am making my own [[digital garden]] available online for anyone who is interested in following my very varied trains of thought. 

Initially, I subscribed to the idea of [[essays/a new way of blogging|a new way of blogging]], since I was particularly interested in [[breaking the chronological order]]. 

But it was clear that at some point there's a chronology associated with the publishing of *more finished* work (see: [[What happens when notes become long]]). For example, if I publish something online on LinkedIn or Twitter, it tends to be associated with an essay I've written. 

So now I have a hybrid system. These notes, that become public with rolling updates (even drafts of essays that my never be finished). And a more "professional website" that displays a bit more concisely my work and thoughts.
