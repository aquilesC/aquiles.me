title: Transclusion
description: Transclusions involve embedding and linking content of different origins on the same visual landscape. A webpage could be composed using various sources, and be used as a source
epistemic: Very early initial considerations. Couldn't yet find a working example of building on transclusions

Transclusion in the digital domain is the possibility of embedding and linking content in order to build a dialog between parts. For example, embedding a tweet, or a video, is a form of transclusion. However, I can't embed parts of a web page in order to compose a new one. 

In my mind, I can't think about transclusion without thinking about Cortázar's book: [Último Round](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Altimo_round).

Maggie Appleton[^1] [@zotero-374] discusses transclusions in a way it reminded me of how [[Web Mentions and Comments|webmentions]] work, and what the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) proposes (see [the microformats specification](https://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page)). She quickly identifies the caveats associated with embedding content of others, mainly of link rot, but also of moderation nightmares (I briefly discuss this on [[Web Mentions and Comments]]). 

Should transclusion  work both ways, embedding content and letting the source know that I did so? I find that [Hypotes.is](https://hypothes.is/) is building in that direction, adding notes and highlights (public, private, or shareable) directly on the website. It is missing, however, the version-control aspect of it. If the source changes, the notes become meaningless. Zotero stores a copy of the website. See also what [Gwern does](https://www.gwern.net/About#development) to guarantee long-term retrievability of the content they link to. 

The [[federated wiki]] is an early example of transclusion between websites that follow a standard. Pop-over links are also a visual way of transclusion. Is it possible to think about non-visual transclusion? For example, transclusion can come up in the way of concepts and knowledge, even if they are not pieces of written material that can be embedded into a page. (see: [[incremental change leads to unsustainable educational paradigms]]).

Most challenges of transclusion are lifted if one considers private networks of knowledge (private but not necessarily individually own). For example, a knowledge network of a company, research group, etc. Sources are immediately vouched for, and content could be either public-facing or only internal. I wonder if there is any system in place for this to work in closed communities of people.
