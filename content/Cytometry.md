The etymology comes from the meaning of *kytos* which means hollow vessel in Greek. Therefore, [[flow cytometer]] refers to a specific way of measuring cells. However, the hollow vessel image is also appropriate for [[extracellular vesicle]], and therefore [[nanoFCM]], for example, is still a good name.
