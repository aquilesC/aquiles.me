title: Return of Oñate's Foot (Podcast)
---
I have listened to the podcast on 99p Invisible about Oñate's foot[^1]. One of the *conquistadores* that first settled in New Mexico was quite a villain, but history washed out his figure for a while. One of the things he has done was chopping off the foot of males that somehow didn't comply with his wishes. 

At some point in time, his figure was reviewed, and among things that happened, someone chopped off the foot out of a statue. This was a great symbol in order to put back into people's memory what this figure meant. The podcast discusses many other historical aspects, but the most important message is about the role these past figures can have in oppressing communities.
