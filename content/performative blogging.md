Most blogs (new replaced by newsletters) serve a purpose. Either to establish a person as a thought leader, to establish a company as trustworthy, or because someone wants to sell something. 

This means there is [[measuring performance using single criteria|performance criteria]] that can be optimized, which in turn means content, format, topics, are tailored towards them. 

I see a public [[digital garden]] as a space without extrinsic metrics. I still see my garden as a [[learning in public]] experiment. Fair, the impact is minimal, but it makes me feel somewhat proud that my thoughts are reachable by anyone with enough patience. 

Blogging has a place which, by no means, has been eroded by digital gardens. Organized thoughts and well researched topics add value to the readers.
