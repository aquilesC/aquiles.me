When people assume that brilliance is associated with a specific type of person, specifically a male[^1]. This can be seen in the experiments of "Draw a scientist", that goes from gender-balanced to male-dominated while boys and girls go from 5 to 7 years of age. 

The fallacy is clear: men can be brilliant, therefore to be brilliant one must be a man.
