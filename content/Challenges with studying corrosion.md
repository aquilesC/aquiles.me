Some of the challenges involve: lengthy and slow processes, it is hard to make "real-time" decisions. Accelerated corrosion may or may not represent the reality of the context where materials are placed (different weather, impact of temperature, etc.)

For example [[@ISO 18069_2015]] defines a way of characterizing corrosion by immersing metals in different liquids. However, it is a process that takes days, with interactions every few hours.
