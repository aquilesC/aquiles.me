The core principle of size exclusion chromatography ([[SEC]]) is to create a high gradient of diffusion coefficients for particles of different sizes. Small particles will diffuse slower than bigger particles (contrary to [[brownian diffusion]]). If a column is made, and one collects what comes down, the size of the particles will depend on the time of collection. 

[[iZon]] sells some beads that induce this different diffusion coefficient, and a tool that automatically spins at given intervals in order to collect the sample that falls through at precise intervals. 

[[Cell guidance systems]] sells the exo-spin[^1] system, which is essentially the same as the iZon's, but columns must be centrifuged. I don't know the difference between both systems, or whether it is a matter of speeding up the process. The price per column (Feb 2021) is around â‚¬15. 

I assume the same principle would work for charged particles under an electrical field, for example. Perhaps it is not so different from what gel electrophoresis does, but without involving a gel and therefore having a much cleaner resulting sample? 

I wonder [[why the name chromatography]] if it does not involve color at all. Perhaps historical reasons?
