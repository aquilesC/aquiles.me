# Dispertech

At [Dispertech](https://www.dispertech.com) we want to empower researchers by unlocking the potential of [[extracellular vesicle|extracellular vesicles]] as biomarkers and drug delivery systems. We also started focusing our attention on the problems arising from [[nanomedicine]]. We employ [[hollow optical fiber]] in combination with [[nanoparticle tracking analysis]] to measure the size with unprecedented accuracy.

## Our History
Dispertech is the brain child of [[Sanli Faez]]. He developed the technique while doing a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute, first, and later at Leiden University. I joined Sanli's lab in Utrecht University as a part-time postdoc in order to develop the business plan while also participating in [[UtrechtInc]], an incubator associated with the University. 

We were joined by [[Nascent Ventures]] since the beginning, which allowed us to quickly build a company. Both [[Steven Tan]] and [[Hans Brouwer]] bring a lot of experience to the business side of the project, including their network of manufactures, suppliers, legal, and technical knowledge. 

This project is what allows me to experience entrepreneurship and [[technology transfer]] from a first-hand perspective.
