[[@mazzucato2018]] argues that there is ample evidence that without state spending, innovation would stagnate. Private companies are not innovators in themselves, but they mostly ride waves initiated by risk-taking state policies. 

In that view, exporting ideas that are counter factual is a great approach to keeping other states less competitive. It is a cynical view, but when a powerful country like the United States is in the position of dictating policies abroad (thinking about the [[Washington Consensus]], for example) they may simply act on their best interests. 

Perhaps it is rooted in a delusional view of the world, kept alive only by a strong state (US policies after all are closer to european fascism than to latin american populism) supporting long term visions and leaving free players to speak their minds.
