The idea of [[note taking]] is to either create knowledge (see: [[taking notes for knowledge creation]]), or to eventually turn the notes into a written product. I call it *product* purposely to avoid specifying whether it is a blog post, a paper, a book, or an article. 

There are some problems with the traditional approach to writing products being thought in universities (see: [[literature/202011092209 Writing projects should flow associatevely and not with a top-down approach]]), while associative, networked methods may be much better suited for innovative writing. 

Either if we think about [[The Luhmann method]] in light of academic writing or of the [[digital garden]], the basic unit of value generation are the [[notes should be concept-based|concept-oriented notes]], in which case:

> if youâ€™ve already written lots of concept-oriented evergreen notes around the topic, your task is more like editing than composition. You can make an outline by shuffling the note titles, write notes on any missing material, and edit them together into a narrative.

Well formatted notes, especially if we pay attention to [[Tendering a digital garden]], could become a fantastic tool to speed up the time it takes to sit down and write with novel insights. However, I still wonder [[where does observation fit into the digital garden]].
