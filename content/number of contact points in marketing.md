One of the purposes of [[Marketing]] is to increase awareness (see [[levels of awareness for marketing]]) until a *prospect* enters the sales process. One of the challenges with modern marketing approaches is that the [[customer journey]] is not linear, and therefore one must take into account [[customer journey and touchpoints]], as well as leveraging [[jobs theory and customer journeys]]. 

There is some anecdotal evidence that the number of times a person needs to be in touch with a company varies between 5 and 7 before they are convinced to start the purchasing. (Of course, this is for [[deep tech]] companies, not sure for others). 

In this perspective, an unanswered cold-email (assuming it was read) counts towards the total number of exposures. 

[[Evergreen marketing]] may be an effective way of lowering costs.
