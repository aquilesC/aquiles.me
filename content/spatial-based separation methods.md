These methods are an alternative to [[Time-based separation methods]]. 
However, they are not fully implemented and available. 

In essence, the gradient to separate objects is created in space instead of time. Having a physical separation offers the opportunity to filter and, more importantly, to run samples continuously, hence overcoming the largest [[limits of time-based separation methods]]. 

[[tangential-flow-filtration]] and [[free flow electrophoresis]] are two methods that can be seen as spatial separation methods. 

One of the advantages of not relying on gravity, is that they can be implemented in space (either for research or as a health tool).
