These are particle, molecule, or cell, separation methods that rely on the residence time of the sample to create enrichment. 

In [[size exclusion chromatography]], for example, smaller particles stay longer in the column (diffuse slower). Effectively, one would put a given volume on the top, and the same volume would come out from the bottom with a gradient of sizes. 

Other methods are: [[HPLC]] and [[Flow induced dispersion analysis]]. 

An alternative are [[spatial-based separation methods]].
