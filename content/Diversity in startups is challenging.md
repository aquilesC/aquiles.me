While larger institutions have the ability to institute policies and have resources to [[foster diversity in companies]], [[startup|startups]] struggle. Of the [[literature/202304141541 Diversity efforts that work|efforts that seem to work]], the only thing that a startup can do is test for biased technology, while the others work at larger scales. 

Startups can't always wait long enough to increase the diversity pool of candidates applying to a position, nor have enough visibility to increase their reach when seeking for new colleagues. 

However, the pattern that repeats in startups is that they are highly flexible and challenging environments, which should lead to an immediate [[learning environment]], and [[literature/202304141533 Learning environments foster diversity|learning environments foster diversity]].
