During the [[Pleistocene extinctions]], not only animals disappeared, but also other hominin groups. Following the [[overkill hypothesis]], it could be extrapolated to thinking that humans drove other hominin groups to extinction by selectively killing them. This is the specific view of Harari[@harari2015] which claims that H. Sapiens drove a genocide on other hominins. 

However, this self-fulfilling profecy may not be completely accurate. First, [[not all hominins drove extinctions in islands]], which points to some deficiencies on the [[overkill hypothesis]] (although this is so easy to understand and justify that compelling counter-arguments are normally more involved). Moreover, the [[mixing between modern humans and Neanderthals]] shows that cohabitation rather than extermination drove the evolutionary forces of human development.
