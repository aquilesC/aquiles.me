Tetraspanins like [[CD9]], [[CD63]], and [[CD81]] are often used as markers for [[EV]]'s, however [[CD9 and CD63 are used as biomarkers in EVs but they can change from cell line to cell line]]. A thorough analysis of the proteome identified [[syntenin-1]] as the highest abundant protein and putative universal biomarker[@kugeratski2021]. 

However, the biggest challenge is that [[syntenin-1]] is an intraluminal protein and therefore requires permebealization of the membrane to be used as a marker. The image bellow [@kugeratski2021] shows the difference with the use of CD63:

Therefore, [[syntenin-1]] is an abundant protein but may not be the best marker to use in real-life experiments, and much less for any *in-vivo* assay.
