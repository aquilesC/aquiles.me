The design of the maternity leave, considering the time and money received can have a lasting impact on the overall economic outcome of women[^1]. Part-time works are under-paid compared to full-time jobs, and are more likely to be taken by women who need more flexibility to take care of children. 

The length of the maternity leave is one of the factors that influence adoption, and also the pay. Not in all countries maternity leave is paid in full, with percentages dropping to even 30% of the normal salary or less. 

One of the consequences of maternity is that the overall earnings of a woman through their working life are lower than those of men.
