In the early 80's, the team behind the Lisa software decided to rate developers' productivity by the number of lines of code they would generate. It is a concrete example of what happens when [[measuring performance using single criteria]]. 

Bill Atkinson quickly realized the number of lines of code was a bad metric, since it incentivizes code with poor performance and bloated architecture.[@hertzfeld1982]

That's why he decided to optimize some part of the code he was working on, and submit a management form claiming he contributed $-2000$ lines of code. 

That was all it took to review the performance metrics.
