  {"id":"adams2021","abstract":"Improving objects, ideas or situations—whether a designer seeks to advance technology, a writer seeks to strengthen an argument or a manager seeks to encourage desired behaviour—requires a mental search for possible changes1–3. We investigated whether people are as likely to consider changes that subtract components from an object, idea or situation as they are to consider changes that add new components. People typically consider a limited number of promising ideas in order to manage the cognitive burden of searching through all possible ideas, but this can lead them to accept adequate solutions without considering potentially superior alternatives4–10. Here we show that people systematically default to searching for additive transformations, and consequently overlook subtractive transformations. Across eight experiments, participants were less likely to identify advantageous subtractive changes when the task did not (versus did) cue them to consider subtraction, when they had only one opportunity (versus several) to recognize the shortcomings of an additive search strategy or when they were under a higher (versus lower) cognitive load. Defaulting to searches for additive changes may be one reason that people struggle to mitigate overburdened schedules11, institutional red tape12 and damaging effects on the planet13,14. Observational and experimental studies of people seeking to improve objects, ideas or situations demonstrate that people default to searching for solutions that add new components rather than for solutions that remove existing components.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Adams","given":"Gabrielle S."},{"family":"Converse","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Hales","given":"Andrew H."},{"family":"Klotz","given":"Leidy E."}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03380-y","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7853","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4]]},"language":"en","number":"7853","page":"258-261","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"People systematically overlook subtractive changes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03380-y","volume":"592"},
  {"id":"adegoke2021","abstract":"New point-of-care diagnostic approaches for malaria that are sensitive to low parasitemia, easy to use in a field setting, and affordable are urgently required to meet the World Health Organization’s objective of reducing malaria cases and related life losses by 90% globally on or before 2030. In this study, an inexpensive “matchbox size” near-infrared (NIR) spectrophotometer was used for the first time to detect and quantify malaria infection in vitro from isolated dried red blood cells using a fingerpick volume of blood. This the first study to apply a miniaturized NIR device to diagnose a parasitic infection and identify marker bands indicative of malaria infection in the NIR region. An NIR device has many advantages including wavelength accuracy and repeatability, speed, resolution, and a greatly improved signal-to-noise ratio compared to existing spectroscopic options. Using multivariate data analysis, we discriminated control red blood cells from infected cells and established the limit of detection of the technique. Principal component analysis displayed a good separation between the infected and uninfected RBCs, while partial least-squares regression analysis yielded a robust parasitemia prediction with root-mean-square error of prediction values of 0.446 and 0.001% for the higher and lower parasitemia models, respectively. The R2 values of the higher and lower parasitemia models were 0.947 and 0.931, respectively. Finally, an estimated parasitemia detection limit of 0.00001% and a qunatification limit of 0.001% was achieved; to ascertain the true efficacy of the technique for point-of-care screening, clinical studies using large patient numbers are required, which is the subject of future studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Adegoke","given":"John A."},{"family":"Kochan","given":"Kamila"},{"family":"Heraud","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Bayden R."}],"container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

We identify 3 million mentor–protégé pairs and survey a random sample, verifying that their relationship involved some form of mentorship. We find that mentorship quality predicts the scientific impact of the papers written by protégés post mentorship without their mentors. We also find that increasing the proportion of female mentors is associated not only with a reduction in post-mentorship impact of female protégés, but also a reduction in the gain of female mentors. While current diversity policies encourage same-gender mentorships to retain women in academia, our findings raise the possibility that opposite-gender mentorship may actually increase the impact of women who pursue a scientific career. These findings add a new perspective to the policy debate on how to best elevate the status of women in science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"AlShebli","given":"Bedoor"},{"family":"Makovi","given":"Kinga"},{"family":"Rahwan","given":"Talal"}],"container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-19723-8","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"5855","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The association between early career informal mentorship in academic collaborations and junior author performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19723-8","volume":"11"},

Polymerase chain reaction is a powerful method for rapid and accurate diagnosis of infectious diseases and bio-warfare agents. The fully integrated system and disposable disc developed here automates the fluidic pumping, valving, and rapid thermocycling required for polymerase chain reaction. We demonstrate the first utilization of ice-valving in an integrated centrifugal microfluidic system as a method for sealing the thermocycling chamber to reduce fluid loss due to evaporation. The automated centrifugal system is validated via amplification of a B. anthracis gene.

  {"id":"an2021","abstract":"Anemia, characterized by low blood hemoglobin level, affects about 25% of the world's population with the heaviest burden borne by women and children. Anemia leads to impaired cognitive development in children, as well as high morbidity and early mortality among sufferers. Anemia can be caused by nutritional deficiencies, oncologic treatments and diseases, infections such as malaria, as well as inherited hemoglobin or red cell disorders. Effective treatments are available for anemia upon early detection and the treatment method is highly dependent on the cause of anemia. There is a need for point-of-care (POC) screening, early diagnosis, and monitoring, which are currently not widely accessible due to technical challenges and cost, especially in low- and middle-income countries where anemia is most prevalent. This review first introduces the evolution of developed anemia detection methods followed by their implementation in current commercially available POC anemia detection devices. Emerging POC anemia detection technologies leveraging novel methods are reviewed. Finally, we highlight the future trends of integrating anemia detection with the diagnosis of relevant underlying disorders to accurately identify specific root causes and to facilitate personalized treatment and care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"An","given":"Ran"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yuning"},{"family":"Man","given":"Yuncheng"},{"family":"Valentine","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Kucukal","given":"Erdem"},{"family":"Goreke","given":"Utku"},{"family":"Sekyonda","given":"Zoe"},{"family":"Piccone","given":"Connie"},{"family":"Owusu-Ansah","given":"Amma"},{"family":"Ahuja","given":"Sanjay"},{"family":"Little","given":"Jane A."},{"family":"Gurkan","given":"Umut A."}],"container-title":"Lab on a Chip","container-title-short":"Lab Chip","DOI":"10.1039/D0LC01235A","ISSN":"1473-0189","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,31]]},"language":"en","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","source":"pubs.rsc.org","title":"Emerging Point-of-Care Technologies for Anemia Detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/lc/d0lc01235a"},

A realistic risk assessment must stand on representative data on the abundance, size distribution and chemical composition of microplastics. Raman microscopy is an indispensable tool for the analysis of very small microplastics (<20 mm). Still, its use is far from widespread, in part due to drawbacks such as long measurement time and proneness to spectral distortion induced by ﬂuorescence. This review discusses each drawback followed by a showcase of interesting and easily available solutions that contribute to faster and better identiﬁcation of microplastics using Raman spectroscopy. Among discussed topics are: enhanced signal quality with better detectors and spectrum processing; automated particle selection for faster Raman mapping; comprehensive reference libraries for successful spectral matching.

For small ions, this coupling includes the net effect of the external applied field, the internal field of the double layer, and the non-uniform velocity of the liquid. Adsorption/desorption kinetics and the effects of surface roughness may also be important in nanochannel electrophoresis.

  {"id":"barella2020","abstract":"Several fields of applications require a reliable characterization of the photothermal response and heat dissipation of nanoscopic systems, which remains a challenging task for both modeling and experimental measurements. Here, we present an implementation of anti-Stokes thermometry that enables the in situ photothermal characterization of individual nanoparticles (NPs) from a single hyperspectral photoluminescence confocal image. The method is label-free, potentially applicable to any NP with detectable anti-Stokes emission, and does not require any prior information about the NP itself or the surrounding media. With it, we first studied the photothermal response of spherical gold NPs of different sizes on glass substrates, immersed in water, and found that heat dissipation is mainly dominated by the water for NPs larger than 50 nm. Then, the role of the substrate was studied by comparing the photothermal response of 80 nm gold NPs on glass with sapphire and graphene, two materials with high thermal conductivity. For a given irradiance level, the NPs reach temperatures 18% lower on sapphire and 24% higher on graphene than on bare glass. The fact that the presence of a highly conductive material such as graphene leads to a poorer thermal dissipation demonstrates that interfacial thermal resistances play a very significant role in nanoscopic systems and emphasize the need for in situ experimental thermometry techniques. The developed method will allow addressing several open questions about the role of temperature in plasmon-assisted applications, especially ones where NPs of arbitrary shapes are present in complex matrixes and environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Barella","given":"Mariano"},{"family":"Violi","given":"Ianina L."},{"family":"Gargiulo","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Luciana P."},{"family":"Goschin","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Guglielmotti","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Pallarola","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Schlücker","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Pilo-Pais","given":"Mauricio"},{"family":"Acuna","given":"Guillermo P."},{"family":"Maier","given":"Stefan A."},{"family":"Cortés","given":"Emiliano"},{"family":"Stefani","given":"Fernando D."}],"container-title":"ACS Nano","container-title-short":"ACS Nano","DOI":"10.1021/acsnano.0c06185","ISSN":"1936-0851","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,17]]},"publisher":"American Chemical Society","source":"ACS Publications","title":"In Situ Photothermal Response of Single Gold Nanoparticles through Hyperspectral Imaging Anti-Stokes Thermometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c06185"},

Certainly, there are some important differences, but more and more we are learning that we differ by degree rather than kind. We see these similarities most clearly when we look at human populations that live a more traditional, foraging lifestyle. Barsbai et al. compared more than 300 such foraging human populations with mammal and bird species living in the same environment across a wide array of environmental conditions (see the Perspective by Hill and Boyd). They found that all three groups converged with regard to foraging, social, and reproductive behaviors. Thus, adaptation to environmental selection shapes similar responses across a wide diversity of life forms.\nScience, this issue p. 292; see also p. 235\nBehavior is a way for organisms to respond flexibly to the environmental conditions they encounter.

  {"id":"bazant2004","abstract":"The response of a model micro-electrochemical system to a time-dependent applied voltage is analyzed. The article begins with a fresh historical review including electrochemistry, colloidal science, and microfluidics. The model problem consists of a symmetric binary electrolyte between parallel-plate, blocking electrodes which suddenly apply a voltage. Compact Stern layers on the electrodes are also taken into account. The Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations are first linearized and solved by Laplace transforms for small voltages, and numerical solutions are obtained for large voltages. The ``weakly nonlinear'' limit of thin double layers is then analyzed by matched asymptotic expansions in the small parameter $\\epsilon = \\lambda_D/L$, where $\\lambda_D$ is the screening length and $L$ the electrode separation. At leading order, the system initially behaves like an RC circuit with a response time of $\\lambda_D L / D$ (not $\\lambda_D^2/D$), where $D$ is the ionic diffusivity, but nonlinearity violates this common picture and introduce multiple time scales. The charging process slows down, and neutral-salt adsorption by the diffuse part of the double layer couples to bulk diffusion at the time scale, $L^2/D$. In the ``strongly nonlinear'' regime (controlled by a dimensionless parameter resembling the Dukhin number), this effect produces bulk concentration gradients, and, at very large voltages, transient space charge. The article concludes with an overview of more general situations involving surface conduction, multi-component electrolytes, and Faradaic processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bazant","given":"Martin Z."},{"family":"Thornton","given":"Katsuyo"},{"family":"Ajdari","given":"Armand"}],"container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

This article quantifies the stages of drug discovery in which improvements in the time taken, success rate or affordability will have the most profound overall impact on bringing new drugs to market. Changes in clinical success rates will have the most profound impact on improving success in drug discovery; in other words, the quality of decisions regarding which compound to take forward (and how to conduct clinical trials) are more important than speed or cost. Although current advances in AI focus on how to make a given compound, the question of which compound to make, using clinical efficacy and safety-related end points, has received significantly less attention. As a consequence, current proxy measures and available data cannot fully utilize the potential of AI in drug discovery, in particular when it comes to drug efficacy and safety in vivo. Thus, addressing the questions of which data to generate and which end points to model will be key to improving clinically relevant decision-making in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Bender","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Cortés-Ciriano","given":"Isidro"}],"container-title":"Drug Discovery Today","container-title-short":"Drug Discovery Today","DOI":"10.1016/j.drudis.2020.12.009","ISSN":"1359-6446","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"511-524","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Artificial intelligence in drug discovery: what is realistic, what are illusions?

A popular explanation for stagnation is that good ideas are harder to find, rendering slowdown inevitable. We present a simple model of the lifecycle of scientific ideas that points to changes in scientist incentives as the cause of scientific stagnation. Over the last five decades, citations have become the dominant way to evaluate scientific contributions and scientists. This emphasis on citations in the measurement of scientific productivity shifted scientist rewards and behavior on the margin toward incremental science and away from exploratory projects that are more likely to fail, but which are the fuel for future breakthroughs. As attention given to new ideas decreased, science stagnated. We also explore ways to broaden how scientific productivity is measured and rewarded, involving both academic search engines such as Google Scholar measuring which contributions explore newer ideas and university administrators and funding agencies utilizing these new metrics in research evaluation. We demonstrate empirically that measures of novelty are correlated with but distinct from measures of scientific impact, which suggests that if also novelty metrics were utilized in scientist evaluation, scientists might pursue more innovative, riskier, projects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhattacharya","given":"Jay"},{"family":"Packalen","given":"Mikko"}],"DOI":"10.3386/w26752","event-place":"Cambridge, MA","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2]]},"language":"en","number":"w26752","page":"w26752","publisher":"National Bureau of Economic Research","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Stagnation and Scientific Incentives","type":"report","URL":"http://www.nber.org/papers/w26752.pdf"},

  {"id":"boughn2013","abstract":"In 1904, the year before Einstein’s seminal papers on special relativity, Austrian physicist Fritz Hasenöhrl examined the properties of blackbody radiation in a moving cavity. He calculated the work necessary to keep the cavity moving at a constant velocity as it fills with radiation and concluded that the radiation energy has associated with it an apparent mass such that $$E = \\tfrac{3}{8}mc^2$$. In a subsequent paper, also in 1904, Hasenöhrl achieved the same result by computing the force necessary to accelerate a cavity already filled with radiation. In early 1905, he corrected the latter result to $$E = \\tfrac{3}{4}mc^2$$. This result, i.e., $$m = \\tfrac{4}{3}E/c^2$$, has led many to conclude that Hasenöhrl fell victim to the same “mistake” made by others who derived this relation between the mass and electrostatic energy of the electron. Some have attributed the mistake to the neglect of stress in the blackbody cavity. In this paper, Hasenöhrl’s papers are examined from a modern, relativistic point of view in an attempt to understand where he went wrong. The primary mistake in his first paper was, ironically, that he didn’t account for the loss of mass of the blackbody end caps as they radiate energy into the cavity. However, even taking this into account one concludes that blackbody radiation has a mass equivalent of $$m = \\tfrac{4}{3}E/c^2$$or $$m = \\tfrac{5}{3}E/c^2$$depending on whether one equates the momentum or kinetic energy of radiation to the momentum or kinetic energy of an equivalent mass. In his second and third papers that deal with an accelerated cavity, Hasenöhrl concluded that the mass associated with blackbody radiation is $$m = \\tfrac{4}{3}E/c^2$$, a result which, within the restricted context of Hasenöhrl’s gedanken experiment, is actually consistent with special relativity. (If one includes all components of the system, including cavity stresses, then the total mass and energy of the system are, to be sure, related by m = E/c2.) Both of these problems are non-trivial and the surprising results, indeed, turn out to be relevant to the “$$\\tfrac{4}{3}$$problem” in classical models of the electron. An important lesson of these analyses is that E = mc2, while extremely useful, is not a “law of physics” in the sense that it ought not be applied indiscriminately to any extended system and, in particular, to the subsystems from which they are comprised. We suspect that similar problems have plagued attempts to model the classical electron.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Boughn","given":"Stephen"}],"container-title":"The European Physical Journal H","container-title-short":"EPJ H","DOI":"10.1140/epjh/e2012-30061-5","ISSN":"2102-6467","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"261-278","source":"Springer Link","title":"Fritz Hasenöhrl and E = mc2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1140/epjh/e2012-30061-5","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"burns2021","abstract":"Public involvement is key to closing the gap between research production and research use, and the only way to achieving ultimate transparency in science. The majority of life science research is not public-facing, but is funded by the public and impacts communities. We undertook an exploratory survey of researchers within the life sciences to better understand their views and perceived challenges to involving the public in their research. As survey response rate could not be determined, interpretation of the results must be cautious. We had a valid response cohort of n = 110 researchers, of whom 90% were primarily laboratory based. Using a mixed methods approach, we demonstrate that a top-down approach is key to motivate progression of life scientists from feeling positive towards public involvement to actually engaging in it. Researchers who viewed public involvement as beneficial to their research were more likely to have direct experience of doing it. We demonstrate that the systemic flaws in the way life sciences research enterprise is organised, including the promotion system, hyper-competition, and time pressures are major barriers to involving the public in the scientific process. Scientists are also apprehensive of being involuntarily involved in the current politicized climate; misinformation and publicity hype surrounding science nowadays makes them hesitant to share their early and in-progress research. The time required to deliberate study design and relevance, plan and build relationships for sustained involvement, provide and undertake training, and improve communication in the current research environment is often considered nonpragmatic, particularly for early career researchers. In conclusion, a top-down approach involving institutional incentives and infrastructure appears most effective at transitioning researchers from feeling positive towards public involvement to actually implementing it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Burns","given":"John A."},{"family":"Holden","given":"Sinead"},{"family":"Korzec","given":"Kora"},{"family":"Dorris","given":"Emma R."}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0250023","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e0250023","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"From intent to implementation: Factors affecting public involvement in life science research","title-short":"From intent to implementation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250023","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"bush2021","abstract":"Pre-Columbian reforestation in Amazonia\nAn early 17th-century temporary reduction in global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels has now been attributed to reforestation in Amazonia after the catastrophic loss of life of the indigenous population caused by diseases brought by European invaders. Using fossil pollen data from Amazonian lake sediments with temporal resolution over the past millennium, Bush et al. found that forest recovery began 300 to 600 years before the population crash. The more recent nadir in atmospheric CO2 was not associated with rapid reforestation at that time. The vegetation changes appear to be the result of changing patterns of land use in the centuries preceding the European arrival and the resulting devastation, whereas the cause of the CO2 decline remains enigmatic.\nScience, this issue p. 484\nAn estimated 90 to 95% of Indigenous people in Amazonia died after European contact. This population collapse is postulated to have caused decreases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at around 1610 CE, as a result of a wave of land abandonment in the wake of disease, slavery, and warfare, whereby the attendant reversion to forest substantially increased terrestrial carbon sequestration. On the basis of 39 Amazonian fossil pollen records, we show that there was no synchronous reforestation event associated with such an atmospheric carbon dioxide response after European arrival in Amazonia. Instead, we find that, at most sites, land abandonment and forest regrowth began about 300 to 600 years before European arrival. Pre-European pandemics, social strife, or environmental change may have contributed to these early site abandonments and ecological shifts.\nPollen records show that site abandonment and forest regrowth in Amazonia began up to 600 years before European arrival.\nPollen records show that site abandonment and forest regrowth in Amazonia began up to 600 years before European arrival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Bush","given":"M.

  {"id":"cann2021","abstract":"Exposure to media content is an important component of opinion formation around climate change. Online social media such as Twitter, the focus of this study, provide an avenue to study public engagement and digital media dissemination related to climate change. Sharing a link to an online article is an indicator of media engagement. Aggregated link-sharing forms a network structure which maps collective media engagement by the user population. Here we construct bipartite networks linking Twitter users to the web pages they shared, using a dataset of approximately 5.3 million English-language tweets by almost 2 million users during an eventful seven-week period centred on the announcement of the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Community detection indicates that the observed information-sharing network can be partitioned into two weakly connected components, representing subsets of articles shared by a group of users. We characterise these partitions through analysis of web domains and text content from shared articles, finding them to be broadly described as a left-wing/environmentalist group and a right-wing/climate sceptic group. Correlation analysis shows a striking positive association between left/right political ideology and environmentalist/sceptic climate ideology respectively. Looking at information-sharing over time, there is considerable turnover in the engaged user population and the articles that are shared, but the web domain sources and polarised network structure are relatively persistent. This study provides evidence that online sharing of news media content related to climate change is both polarised and politicised, with implications for opinion dynamics and public debate around this important societal challenge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Cann","given":"Tristan J.

In this work we use the spectrum of the anti-Stokes emission from gold nanorods irradiated in resonance to measure the absolute temperature of the nanoparticles and their surrounding medium without the need for a previous calibration. We show a 4 K accuracy in the determination of the temperature of the medium with spectral measurements of 180 s integration time.

If a strong heterocoagulation happened, a single-modal electrophoretic mobility distribution with only one peak could be determined, and the peak located between the peaks of the two individual minerals. Without heterocoagulation, a bimodal electrophoretic mobility distribution with two peaks could be observed, which was consistent with the peaks of the two individual minerals.

We uncovered more than 3 million previously undescribed variants, most of which were found among individuals from newly sampled ethnolinguistic groups, as well as 62 previously unreported loci that are under strong selection, which were predominantly found in genes that are involved in viral immunity, DNA repair and metabolism. We observed complex patterns of ancestral admixture and putative-damaging and novel variation, both within and between populations, alongside evidence that Zambia was a likely intermediate site along the routes of expansion of Bantu-speaking populations. Pathogenic variants in genes that are currently characterized as medically relevant were uncommon—but in other genes, variants denoted as ‘likely pathogenic’ in the ClinVar database were commonly observed. Collectively, these findings refine our current understanding of continental migration, identify gene flow and the response to human disease as strong drivers of genome-level population variation, and underscore the scientific imperative for a broader characterization of the genomic diversity of African individuals to understand human ancestry and improve health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Choudhury","given":"Ananyo"},{"family":"Aron","given":"Shaun"},{"family":"Botigué","given":"Laura R."},{"family":"Sengupta","given":"Dhriti"},{"family":"Botha","given":"Gerrit"},{"family":"Bensellak","given":"Taoufik"},{"family":"Wells","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Kumuthini","given":"Judit"},{"family":"Shriner","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Fakim","given":"Yasmina J."},{"family":"Ghoorah","given":"Anisah W."},{"family":"Dareng","given":"Eileen"},{"family":"Odia","given":"Trust"},{"family":"Falola","given":"Oluwadamilare"},{"family":"Adebiyi","given":"Ezekiel"},{"family":"Hazelhurst","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Mazandu","given":"Gaston"},{"family":"Nyangiri","given":"Oscar A."},{"family":"Mbiyavanga","given":"Mamana"},{"family":"Benkahla","given":"Alia"},{"family":"Kassim","given":"Samar K."},{"family":"Mulder","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Adebamowo","given":"Sally N."},{"family":"Chimusa","given":"Emile R."},{"family":"Muzny","given":"Donna"},{"family":"Metcalf","given":"Ginger"},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Rotimi","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Ramsay","given":"Michèle"},{"family":"Adeyemo","given":"Adebowale A."},{"family":"Lombard","given":"Zané"},{"family":"Hanchard","given":"Neil A."}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2859-7","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7831","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10]]},"language":"en","number":"7831","page":"741-748","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"High-depth African genomes inform human migration and health","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2859-7","volume":"586"},

  {"id":"cimorelli2021","abstract":"The particle size distribution (PSD) of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and other submicron particles in biofluids is commonly measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS). A new technique for measuring the PSD is microfluidic resistive pulse sensing (MRPS). Because specific guidelines for measuring EVs together with other particles in biofluids with MRPS are lacking, we developed an operating procedure to reproducibly measure the PSD. The PSDs of particles in human plasma, conditioned medium of PC3 prostate cancer cell line (PC3 CM), and human urine were measured with MRPS (nCS1, Spectradyne LLC) to investigate: (i) the optimal diluent that reduces the interfacial tension of the sample while keeping EVs intact, (ii) the lower limit of detection (LoD) of particle size, (iii) the reproducibility of the PSD, (iv) the optimal dilution for measuring the PSD, and (v) the agreement in measured concentration between microfluidic cartridges with overlapping detection ranges. We found that the optimal diluent is 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline. Based on the shape of the PSD, which is expected to follow a power-law function within the full detection range, we obtained a lower LoD of 75 nm for plasma and PC3 CM and 65 nm for urine. Normalized PSDs are reproducible (R2 > 0.950) at dilutions between 10–100x for plasma, 5–20x for PC3 CM, and 2–4x for urine. Furthermore, sample dilution does not impact the dilution-corrected concentration when the microfluidic cartridges are operated within their specified concentration ranges. PSDs from microfluidic cartridges with overlapping detection ranges agreed well (R2 > 0.936) and when combined the overall PSD spanned 5 orders of magnitude of measured concentration. Based on these findings, we have developed operating guidelines to reproducibly measure the PSD of EVs together with other particles in biofluids with MRPS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Cimorelli","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Nieuwland","given":"Rienk"},{"family":"Varga","given":"Zoltán"},{"family":"Pol","given":"Edwin","dropping-particle":"van der"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0249603","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e0249603","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Standardized procedure to measure the size distribution of extracellular vesicles together with other particles in biofluids with microfluidic resistive pulse sensing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249603","volume":"16"},

Reductionism and emergence play an intertwined role in the everyday life of the physicist, yet we rarely stop to contemplate their relationship: indeed, the two are often regarded as conflicting world-views of science. I argue that in practice, they compliment one-another, forming an awkward alliance in a fashion envisioned by the Renaissance scientist, Francis Bacon. Looking at the historical record in classical and quantum physics, I discuss how emergence fits into a reductionist view of nature. Often, a deep understanding of reductionist physics depends on the understanding of its emergent consequences. Thus the concept of energy was unknown to Newton, Leibnitz, Lagrange or Hamilton, because they did not understand heat. Similarly, the understanding of the weak force awaited an understanding of the Meissner effect in superconductivity. Emergence can thus be likened to an encrypted consequence of reductionism. Taking examples from current research, including topological insulators and strange metals, I show that the convection between emergence and reductionism continues to provide a powerful driver for frontier scientific research, linking the lab with the cosmos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Coleman","given":"Piers"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1702.06884 [cond-mat, physics:physics]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,7]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Emergence and Reductionism: an awkward Baconian alliance","title-short":"Emergence and Reductionism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06884"},

  {"id":"dapp2021","abstract":"Self-evaluations play an important role in various fields of study, specifically in research on metacognition and self-concept. Although the assumption that self-evaluations as known from metacognitive monitoring and academic self-concept are related has received wide agreement, the nature of such a relationship has only rarely been investigated. In the current study, the individual-differences approach that has occasionally addressed this association is discussed and extended twofold. For one, a novel way to compare metacognition and self-concept is presented by computing a self-concept bias—analogous to metacognition research. For another, the study targeted a younger population, namely first-grade children. In line with previous studies, the results confirmed a weak relation between metacognitive monitoring and academic self-concept when relating the two constructs at the absolute level of confidence. However, relating the constructs by means of the respective biases revealed a more substantial association. Thus, while previous studies have assumed the common thread between metacognition and self-concept to be best explained by a general confidence trait, the present study suggests the accuracy of self-evaluations to be at stake instead. Hence, by introducing a method to quantify a bias in self-concept, the current study proposes a new and promising way to compare and relate the constructs of metacognition and self-concept.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Dapp","given":"Laura C."},{"family":"Roebers","given":"Claudia M."}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0250845","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e0250845","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Metacognition and self-concept: Elaborating on a construct relation in first-grade children","title-short":"Metacognition and self-concept","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250845","volume":"16"},

Because life today thrives not just in the temperate ocean and lakes but also in extreme conditions of temperature, salinity, and pH, there is a general assumption that any form of liquid water would be sufficient to support the origin of life as long as there are sources of chemical energy and simple organic compounds. We argue here that the first forms of life would be physically and chemically fragile and would be strongly affected by ionic solutes and pH. A hypothesis emerges from this statement that hot springs associated with volcanic land masses have an ionic composition more conducive to self-assembly and polymerization than seawater. Here we have compared the ionic solutes of seawater with those of terrestrial hot springs.

Here, we describe a highly-sensitive CRISPR-Cas9-based reporter system that allows direct functional study of EV-mediated transfer of small non-coding RNA molecules at single-cell resolution. Using this CRISPR operated stoplight system for functional intercellular RNA exchange (CROSS-FIRE) we uncover various genes involved in EV subtype biogenesis that play a regulatory role in RNA transfer. Moreover we identify multiple genes involved in endocytosis and intracellular membrane trafficking that strongly regulate EV-mediated functional RNA delivery.

Both micrometer-resolution particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) and particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) techniques have been used to quantify and study flow phenomena in electrokinetic systems applicable to microfluidic bioanalytical devices. To make the flow measurements quantitative, we performed a series of seed particle calibration experiments. First, we measure the electroosmotic wall mobility of a borosilicate rectangular capillary (40 by 400 μm) using current monitoring. In addition to this wall mobility characterization, we apply PTV to determine the electrophoretic mobilities of more than 1000 fluorescent microsphere particles in aqueous buffer solutions. Particles from this calibrated particle/buffer mixture are then introduced into two electrokinetic flow systems for particle tracking flow experiments. In these experiments, we use micro-PIV, together with an electric field prediction, to obtain electroosmotic flow bulk fluid velocity measurements. The first example flow system is a microchannel intersection where we demonstrate a detailed documentation of the similitude between the electrical fields and the velocity fields in an electrokinetic system with uniform zeta potential, ζ. In the second system, we apply micro-PIV to a microchannel system with nonuniform ζ. The latter experiment provides a simultaneous measurement of two distinct wall mobilities within the microchannel.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Devasenathipathy","given":"Shankar"},{"family":"Santiago","given":"Juan G."},{"family":"Takehara","given":"Kohsei"}],"container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

  {"id":"driedonks2018","abstract":"The release and uptake of nano-sized extracellular vesicles (EV) is a highly conserved means of intercellular communication. The molecular composition of EV, and thereby their signaling function to target cells, is regulated by cellular activation and differentiation stimuli. EV are regarded as snapshots of cells and are, therefore, in the limelight as biomarkers for disease. Although research on EV-associated RNA has predominantly focused on microRNAs, the transcriptome of EV consists of multiple classes of small non-coding RNAs with potential gene-regulatory functions. It is not known whether environmental cues imposed on cells induce specific changes in a broad range of EV-associated RNA classes. Here, we investigated whether immune-activating or -suppressing stimuli imposed on primary dendritic cells affected the release of various small noncoding RNAs via EV. The small RNA transcriptomes of highly pure EV populations free from ribonucleoprotein particles were analyzed by RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR. Immune stimulus-specific changes were found in the miRNA, snoRNA, and Y-RNA content of EV from dendritic cells, whereas tRNA and snRNA levels were much less affected. Only part of the changes in EV-RNA content reflected changes in cellular RNA, which urges caution in interpreting EV as snapshots of cells. By comprehensive analysis of RNA obtained from highly purified EV, we demonstrate that multiple RNA classes contribute to genetic messages conveyed via EV. The identification of multiple RNA classes that display cell stimulation-dependent association with EV is the prelude to unraveling the function and biomarker potential of these EV-RNAs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Driedonks","given":"Tom A.

In particular, we show that the simple and inexpensive laser illumination enables less than 1ms camera exposure time at high magnification on a large field of view without coherence image artifacts, together with a good hologram quality that allows nm-tracking of microscopic beads to be performed.

  {"id":"dyble2015","abstract":"Friends and family?\nEvolutionary theory stresses the importance of living with kin, not least because they share some of our genes. Nevertheless, a large-scale assessment of contemporary hunter-gatherer societies has established a consistent pattern of unrelated individuals living together. Dyble et al. used a modeling approach to suggest that a possible answer to this conundrum is that cohabitation choices are being governed equally by men and women.\nScience, this issue p. 796\nThe social organization of mobile hunter-gatherers has several derived features, including low within-camp relatedness and fluid meta-groups. Although these features have been proposed to have provided the selective context for the evolution of human hypercooperation and cumulative culture, how such a distinctive social system may have emerged remains unclear.

  {"id":"eiberg2008","abstract":"The human eye color is a quantitative trait displaying multifactorial inheritance. Several studies have shown that the OCA2 locus is the major contributor to the human eye color variation. By linkage analysis of a large Danish family, we finemapped the blue eye color locus to a 166 Kbp region within the HERC2 gene. By association analyses, we identified two SNPs within this region that were perfectly associated with the blue and brown eye colors: rs12913832 and rs1129038. Of these, rs12913832 is located 21.152 bp upstream from the OCA2 promoter in a highly conserved sequence in intron 86 of HERC2. The brown eye color allele of rs12913832 is highly conserved throughout a number of species. As shown by a Luciferase assays in cell cultures, the element significantly reduces the activity of the OCA2 promoter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that the two alleles bind different subsets of nuclear extracts. One single haplotype, represented by six polymorphic SNPs covering half of the 3′ end of the HERC2 gene, was found in 155 blue-eyed individuals from Denmark, and in 5 and 2 blue-eyed individuals from Turkey and Jordan, respectively. Hence, our data suggest a common founder mutation in an OCA2 inhibiting regulatory element as the cause of blue eye color in humans. In addition, an LOD score of Z = 4.21 between hair color and D14S72 was obtained in the large family, indicating that RABGGTA is a candidate gene for hair color.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Eiberg","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Troelsen","given":"Jesper"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Mette"},{"family":"Mikkelsen","given":"Annemette"},{"family":"Mengel-From","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Kjaer","given":"Klaus W."},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Lars"}],"container-title":"Human Genetics","container-title-short":"Hum Genet","DOI":"10.1007/s00439-007-0460-x","ISSN":"1432-1203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"177-187","source":"Springer Link","title":"Blue eye color in humans may be caused by a perfectly associated founder mutation in a regulatory element located within the HERC2 gene inhibiting OCA2 expression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-007-0460-x","volume":"123"},

However, applications of such systems are limited due to inefficiency, cytotoxicity and/or immunogenicity. At the same time, the field of natural drug carrier systems has grown rapidly. One of the most prominent examples of such natural carriers are extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are cell-derived membranous particles which play important roles in intercellular communication. EVs possess a number of characteristics that qualify them as promising vehicles for drug delivery. In order to take advantage of these attributes, an in-depth understanding of why EVs are such unique carrier systems and how we can exploit their qualities is pivotal.

  {"id":"erdbrugger","abstract":"The interest in extracellular vesicles (EVs) has grown exponentially over the last decade. Evolving evidence is demonstrating that these EVs are playing an important role in health and disease. They are involved in intercellular communication and have been shown to transfer proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This review focuses on the most commonly used techniques for detection of EVs, to include microparticles, 100–1,000 nm in size, and exosomes, 50–100 nm in size. Conventional flow cytometry is the most prevalent technique, but nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and resistive pulse sensing have also been used to detect EVs. The accurate measurement of these vesicles is challenged by size heterogeneity, low refractive index, and the lack of dynamic measurement range for most of the available technologies. Sample handling during the preanalytical phase can also affect the accuracy of measurements. Currently, there is not one single method which allows phenotyping, sizing, and enumerating the whole range of EVs and, therefore, providing all the necessary information to truly understand the biology of these particles. A combination of methods is probably needed which might also include electron and atomic force microscopy and full RNA, lipid, and protein profiling. © 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Erdbrügger","given":"Uta"},{"family":"Lannigan","given":"Joanne"}],"container-title":"Cytometry Part A","DOI":"10.1002/cyto.a.22795","ISSN":"1552-4930","issue":"2","language":"en","page":"123-134","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Analytical challenges of extracellular vesicle detection: A comparison of different techniques","title-short":"Analytical challenges of extracellular vesicle detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cyto.a.22795","volume":"89"},

  {"id":"faez2015","abstract":"High-speed tracking of single particles is a gateway to understanding physical, chemical, and biological processes at the nanoscale. It is also a major experimental challenge, particularly for small, nanometer-scale particles. Although methods such as confocal or ﬂuorescence microscopy oﬀer both high spatial resolution and high signal-to-background ratios, the ﬂuorescence emission lifetime limits the measurement speed, while photobleaching and thermal diﬀusion limit the duration of measurements. Here we present a tracking method based on elastic light scattering that enables long-duration measurements of nanoparticle dynamics at rates of thousands of frames per second. We contain the particles within a single-mode silica ﬁber having a subwavelength, nanoﬂuidic channel and illuminate them using the ﬁber's strongly conﬁned optical mode. The diﬀusing particles in this cylindrical geometry are continuously illuminated inside the collection focal plane. We show that the method can track unlabeled dielectric particles as small as 20 nm as well as individual cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) virions;26 nm in size and 4.6 megadaltons in mass;at rates of over 3 kHz for durations of tens of seconds. Our setup is easily incorporated into common optical microscopes and extends their detection range to nanometer-scale particles and macromolecules.

  {"id":"felton2021","abstract":"This paper reports a novel, negligible-cost and open-source process for the rapid prototyping of complex microfluidic devices in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using 3D-printed interconnecting microchannel scaffolds. These single-extrusion scaffolds are designed with interconnecting ends and used to quickly configure complex microfluidic systems before being embedded in PDMS to produce an imprint of the microfluidic configuration. The scaffolds are printed using common Material Extrusion (MEX) 3D printers and the limits, cost & reliability of the process are evaluated. The limits of standard MEX 3D-printing with off-the-shelf printer modifications is shown to achieve a minimum channel cross-section of 100×100 μm. The paper also lays out a protocol for the rapid fabrication of low-cost microfluidic channel moulds from the thermoplastic 3D-printed scaffolds, allowing the manufacture of customisable microfluidic systems without specialist equipment. The morphology of the resulting PDMS microchannels fabricated with the method are characterised and, when applied directly to glass, without plasma surface treatment, are shown to efficiently operate within the typical working pressures of commercial microfluidic devices. The technique is further validated through the demonstration of 2 common microfluidic devices; a fluid-mixer demonstrating the effective interconnecting scaffold design, and a microsphere droplet generator. The minimal cost of manufacture means that a 5000-piece physical library of mix-and-match channel scaffolds (100 μm scale) can be printed for ~$0.50 and made available to researchers and educators who lack access to appropriate technology. This simple yet innovative approach dramatically lowers the threshold for research and education into microfluidics and will make possible the rapid prototyping of point-of-care lab-on-a-chip diagnostic technology that is truly affordable the world over.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Felton","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Diaz-Gaxiola","given":"Andrea"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0245206","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,3]]},"language":"en","page":"e0245206","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Negligible-cost microfluidic device fabrication using 3D-printed interconnecting channel scaffolds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245206","volume":"16"},

Controlling for factors such as tropical location, colonial history, and geographical isolation, countries with intensive malaria had income levels in 1995 of only 33% that of countries without malaria, whether or not the countries were in Africa. The high levels of malaria in poor countries are not mainly a consequence of poverty. Malaria is geographically specific. The ecological conditions that support the more efficient malaria mosquito vectors primarily determine the distribution and intensity of the disease. Intensive efforts to eliminate malaria in the most severely affected tropical countries have been largely ineffective. Countries that have eliminated malaria in the past half century have all been either subtropical or islands. These countries' economic growth in the 5 years after eliminating malaria has usually been substantially higher than growth in the neighboring countries. Cross-country regressions for the 1965-1990 period confirm the relationship between malaria and economic growth. Taking into account initial poverty, economic policy, tropical location, and life expectancy, among other factors, countries with intensive malaria grew 1.3% less per person per year, and a 10% reduction in malaria was associated with 0.3% higher growth. Controlling for many other tropical diseases does not change the correlation of malaria with economic growth, and these diseases are not themselves significantly negatively correlated with economic growth. A second independent measure of malaria has a slightly higher correlation with economic growth in the 1980-1996 period. We speculate about the mechanisms that could cause malaria to have such a large impact on the economy, such as foreign investment and economic networks within the country.</p></section>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallup","given":"J.

However, each author started with Shulman’s model and, based on their interpretation, shaped the model in unique ways that fit their perceptions of the data on teacher cognition. Hopefully this book will enhance the reader’s understanding of PCK through an analysis of both historic and current conceptions, an overview of the research literature, and a presentation of the practical implications derived from this model. Does the construct of PCK help or constrain our pursuit of excellence in teacher preparation? The answer to this question is left to the reader. An anticipated result of such contemplation will lead to individual and community exploration, development, and evaluation of alternative models used to study teacher cognition. As with PCK, future models will need to address the following questions: What knowledge do teachers need to possess in order to be effective? What model of teacher knowledge best explains the data that exists and stimulates future attempts to reconcile, synthesize, and expand our knowledge?Regardless of future evaluation, the explication of PCK as a construct and a model has reintroduced the importance of content knowledge into the teaching equation, promoted renewed vigor in the subject-specific teaching areas such as science education, and highlighted the need for integration of the various domains of knowledge in research, teaching, and teacher preparation. Using these criteria, PCK has proven to be an especially fruitful model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Gess-Newsome","given":"Julie"}],"collection-title":"Science & Technology Education Library","container-title":"Examining Pedagogical Content Knowledge: The Construct and its Implications for Science Education","DOI":"10.1007/0-306-47217-1_1","editor":[{"family":"Gess-Newsome","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Lederman","given":"Norman G."}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-0-306-47217-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]},"language":"en","page":"3-17","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"Pedagogical Content Knowledge: An Introduction and Orientation","title-short":"Pedagogical Content Knowledge","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/0-306-47217-1_1"},

  {"id":"gilsing2011","abstract":"Although several studies in the wide body of literature on technology transfer have hinted at differences across industries, this still remains an understudied issue. Our study addresses this topic and considers to what degree technology transfer processes differ across different industrial sectors. To that end, we study to what extent technology transfer processes differ along both types of transfer mechanisms and key barriers inhibiting the transfer process. Based on a survey of Dutch practitioners on both sides of the transfer process, we test a number of hypotheses that differentiates between science-based regimes and development-based regimes. While our findings confirm our hypotheses concerning differences between the regimes regarding the use of specific transfer mechanisms, we also find that both regimes share a number of mechanisms that are similar. In addition, our findings show a remarkable degree of similarity among barriers inhibiting the process. We discuss these findings within the context of the broader literature and formulate policy implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Gilsing","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Bekkers","given":"Rudi"},{"family":"Bodas Freitas","given":"Isabel Maria"},{"family":"Steen","given":"Marianne","non-dropping-particle":"van der"}],"container-title":"Technovation","container-title-short":"Technovation","DOI":"10.1016/j.technovation.2011.06.009","ISSN":"0166-4972","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"638-647","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Differences in technology transfer between science-based and development-based industries: Transfer mechanisms and barriers","title-short":"Differences in technology transfer between science-based and development-based industries","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166497211000927","volume":"31"},

Such platforms rely on the integration of novel materials into the fiber core or cladding, thereby supporting hybrid modes with new characteristics. Here we present experiments that reveal hybrid mode interactions within a doped-core silica fiber containing a central high-index nanofluidic channel. Compared with a standard liquid-filled capillary, calculations predict modes with unique properties emerging as a result of the doped core/cladding interface, possessing a high power fraction inside and outside the nanofluidic channel. Our experiments directly reveal the beating pattern in the fluorescent liquid resulting from the excitation of the first two linearly polarized hybrid modes in this system, being in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. The efficient excitation and beat of such modes in such an off-resonance situation distinguishes our device from regular directional mode couplers and can benefit applications that demand strong coupling between fundamental- and higher-order- modes, e.g. intermodal third-harmonic generation, bidirectional coupling, and nanofluidic sensing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Gomes","given":"André D."},{"family":"Gomes","given":"André D."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jiangbo Tim"},{"family":"Tuniz","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Tuniz","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Markus A."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Markus A."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Markus A."}],"container-title":"Optical Materials Express","container-title-short":"Opt.

We demonstrated that PIP provided significant contrast and resolution enhancement to conventional microscopy through imaging different multi-cellular fluorescent structures, including 3-D branched cells in vitro and live zebrafish embryos. Imaging with the integration of PIP greatly reduced out-of-focus contamination and generated sharper contrast in acquired 2-D plane images when compared with the stand-alone inverted microscope. As a result, the dynamic fluid domain of the beating zebrafish heart was clearly segmented and the functional monitoring of the heart was achieved. Furthermore, the enhanced axial resolution established by thin plane illumination of PIP enabled the 3-D reconstruction of the branched cellular structures, which leads to the improvement on the functionality of the wide field microscopy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Guan","given":"Zeyi"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Juhyun"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Siyan"},{"family":"Jen","given":"Nelson"},{"family":"Hsiai","given":"Tzung"},{"family":"Ho","given":"Chih-Ming"},{"family":"Fei","given":"Peng"}],"container-title":"Biomedical Optics Express","container-title-short":"Biomed.

Analysis of Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene burial practices throughout the Americas situate WMP6 as the earliest and most secure hunter burial in a sample that includes 10 other females in statistical parity with early male hunter burials.

Here we present genome-wide data from three individuals dated to between 45,930 and 42,580 years ago from Bacho Kiro Cave, Bulgaria1,2. They are the earliest Late Pleistocene modern humans known to have been recovered in Europe so far, and were found in association with an Initial Upper Palaeolithic artefact assemblage. Unlike two previously studied individuals of similar ages from Romania7 and Siberia8 who did not contribute detectably to later populations, these individuals are more closely related to present-day and ancient populations in East Asia and the Americas than to later west Eurasian populations. This indicates that they belonged to a modern human migration into Europe that was not previously known from the genetic record, and provides evidence that there was at least some continuity between the earliest modern humans in Europe and later people in Eurasia. Moreover, we find that all three individuals had Neanderthal ancestors a few generations back in their family history, confirming that the first European modern humans mixed with Neanderthals and suggesting that such mixing could have been common.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hajdinjak","given":"Mateja"},{"family":"Mafessoni","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Skov","given":"Laurits"},{"family":"Vernot","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Hübner","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Qiaomei"},{"family":"Essel","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Nagel","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Nickel","given":"Birgit"},{"family":"Richter","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Moldovan","given":"Oana Teodora"},{"family":"Constantin","given":"Silviu"},{"family":"Endarova","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Zahariev","given":"Nikolay"},{"family":"Spasov","given":"Rosen"},{"family":"Welker","given":"Frido"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Geoff M."},{"family":"Sinet-Mathiot","given":"Virginie"},{"family":"Paskulin","given":"Lindsey"},{"family":"Fewlass","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Talamo","given":"Sahra"},{"family":"Rezek","given":"Zeljko"},{"family":"Sirakova","given":"Svoboda"},{"family":"Sirakov","given":"Nikolay"},{"family":"McPherron","given":"Shannon P."},{"family":"Tsanova","given":"Tsenka"},{"family":"Hublin","given":"Jean-Jacques"},{"family":"Peter","given":"Benjamin M."},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Skoglund","given":"Pontus"},{"family":"Kelso","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Pääbo","given":"Svante"}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03335-3","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7853","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4]]},"language":"en","number":"7853","page":"253-257","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Initial Upper Palaeolithic humans in Europe had recent Neanderthal ancestry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03335-3","volume":"592"},

The EVQuant assay can detect individual immobilized EVs as small as 35 nm and determine their concentration in biofluids without extensive EV isolation or purification procedures. It can also identify specific EV subpopulations based on combinations of biomarkers and is used here to identify prostate-derived urinary EVs as CD9-/CD63+. Moreover, characterization of individual EVs allows analysis of their size distribution.

  {"id":"hofstra2020","abstract":"Prior work finds a diversity paradox: diversity breeds innovation, and yet, underrepresented groups that diversify organizations have less successful careers within them. Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well? We study this by utilizing a near-population of ~1.2 million US doctoral recipients from 1977-2015 and following their careers into publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: e.g., novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity’s role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofstra","given":"Bas"},{"family":"Kulkarni","given":"Vivek V."},{"family":"Munoz-Najar Galvez","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"He","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"},{"family":"McFarland","given":"Daniel A."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1915378117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,28]]},"language":"en","page":"9284-9291","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Diversity–Innovation Paradox in Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915378117","volume":"117"},

Here we demonstrate that exosomes from mouse and human lung-, liver- and brain-tropic tumour cells fuse preferentially with resident cells at their predicted destination, namely lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells, liver Kupffer cells and brain endothelial cells. We show that tumour-derived exosomes uptaken by organ-specific cells prepare the pre-metastatic niche. Treatment with exosomes from lung-tropic models redirected the metastasis of bone-tropic tumour cells. Exosome proteomics revealed distinct integrin expression patterns, in which the exosomal integrins α6β4 and α6β1 were associated with lung metastasis, while exosomal integrin αvβ5 was linked to liver metastasis. Targeting the integrins α6β4 and αvβ5 decreased exosome uptake, as well as lung and liver metastasis, respectively. We demonstrate that exosome integrin uptake by resident cells activates Src phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory S100 gene expression. Finally, our clinical data indicate that exosomal integrins could be used to predict organ-specific metastasis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoshino","given":"Ayuko"},{"family":"Costa-Silva","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Tang-Long"},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"Goncalo"},{"family":"Hashimoto","given":"Ayako"},{"family":"Tesic Mark","given":"Milica"},{"family":"Molina","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Kohsaka","given":"Shinji"},{"family":"Di Giannatale","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Ceder","given":"Sophia"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Swarnima"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Caitlin"},{"family":"Soplop","given":"Nadine"},{"family":"Uryu","given":"Kunihiro"},{"family":"Pharmer","given":"Lindsay"},{"family":"King","given":"Tari"},{"family":"Bojmar","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Alexander E."},{"family":"Ararso","given":"Yonathan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tuo"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Haiying"},{"family":"Hernandez","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Joshua M."},{"family":"Dumont-Cole","given":"Vanessa D."},{"family":"Kramer","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Wexler","given":"Leonard H."},{"family":"Narendran","given":"Aru"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Gary K."},{"family":"Healey","given":"John H."},{"family":"Sandstrom","given":"Per"},{"family":"Jørgen Labori","given":"Knut"},{"family":"Kure","given":"Elin H."},{"family":"Grandgenett","given":"Paul M."},{"family":"Hollingsworth","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Sousa","given":"Maria","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Kaur","given":"Sukhwinder"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Maneesh"},{"family":"Mallya","given":"Kavita"},{"family":"Batra","given":"Surinder K."},{"family":"Jarnagin","given":"William R."},{"family":"Brady","given":"Mary S."},{"family":"Fodstad","given":"Oystein"},{"family":"Muller","given":"Volkmar"},{"family":"Pantel","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Minn","given":"Andy J."},{"family":"Bissell","given":"Mina J."},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Kang","given":"Yibin"},{"family":"Rajasekhar","given":"Vinagolu K."},{"family":"Ghajar","given":"Cyrus M."},{"family":"Matei","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Peinado","given":"Hector"},{"family":"Bromberg","given":"Jacqueline"},{"family":"Lyden","given":"David"}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature15756","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7578","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11]]},"language":"en","number":"7578","page":"329-335","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Tumour exosome integrins determine organotropic metastasis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15756","volume":"527"},

A major theme of Andean cosmology appears to be shamanic transcendence and transformation involving the three worlds of the cosmos. To avoid ethnocentrism, a new ontology may be necessary to grasp the full meaning of Andean astronomy. All of the known cases of astronomy in the archaeological record of the Inca appear to be associated with huaca sanctuaries that may also have been state- supported pilgrimage centers. The Sanctuary of Isla del Sol is a paradigmatic example of such a center. Its characteristic features are stonelined channels, sacred rock, gateways for controlling access to ritual space, physical separation of space according to social status, and areas designated for observing the solstice sun. Most of the sites considered in this paper are associated with the June solstice, contain huacas consisting of natural and carved rocks, show evidence of social differentiation of participants, and have channels for natural or offertory liquids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,30]]},"author":[{"literal":"J.

Student evaluations of teaching (SET) play an important role in assessing instructors' teaching quality, and thus impact hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions. Similarly, student ratings of teaching assistants (TA) can impact future career opportunities. We investigated gender bias in student evaluations of TAs. Students in a large, asynchronous, online course were deceptively assigned to either a putative male or putative female TA. In reality, one female TA performed all TA duties, grading assignments and communicating with students under the guise of each student's assigned TA. Overall, evaluations were positive, however, evaluations of the putative male and female TAs demonstrated inconsistency across student gender. Female students demonstrated the greatest variation; 100% of females assigned to the \"male\" TA rated the TA positively, whereas 88% of female students assigned to the \"female\" TA gave positive ratings. This study corroborates literature demonstrating bias against women in SET.

However, epistemology of experiments is not often addressed directly in the educational and pedagogical literature. This warrants an attempt to produce an acceptable reconstruction of the epistemological role of experiments in physics by drawing insight from history and philosophy of physics. Towards that end, the experiments’ role in the 19th-century physics is discussed. We propose here a reconstruction, which is based on the idea that in epistemology of experiments the inductive-like generative justification of knowledge is central. A generative view makes it possible to retain those aspects of experiments which make them purposeful for learning and can give a starting point for students’ own construction of knowledge. The reconstruction also helps to conceive the experiments with their correct historical role and helps to bring back the generative use of experiments in teaching, which, after all, has never vanished from the practice of physics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Koponen","given":"Ismo T."},{"family":"Mäntylä","given":"Terhi"}],"container-title":"Science & Education","container-title-short":"Sci Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s11191-005-3199-6","ISSN":"1573-1901","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"31-54","source":"Springer Link","title":"Generative Role of Experiments in Physics and in Teaching Physics: A Suggestion for Epistemological Reconstruction","title-short":"Generative Role of Experiments in Physics and in Teaching Physics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-005-3199-6","volume":"15"},

Cells release heterogeneous vesicles of different sizes and intracellular origins, including small EVs formed inside endosomal compartments (i.e., exosomes) and EVs of various sizes budding from the plasma membrane. Specific markers for the analysis and isolation of different EV populations are missing, imposing important limitations to understanding EV functions. Here, EVs from human dendritic cells were first separated by their sedimentation speed, and then either by their behavior upon upward floatation into iodixanol gradients or by immuno-isolation. Extensive quantitative proteomic analysis allowing comparison of the isolated populations showed that several classically used exosome markers, like major histocompatibility complex, flotillin, and heat-shock 70-kDa proteins, are similarly present in all EVs. We identified proteins specifically enriched in small EVs, and define a set of five protein categories displaying different relative abundance in distinct EV populations. We demonstrate the presence of exosomal and nonexosomal subpopulations within small EVs, and propose their differential separation by immuno-isolation using either CD63, CD81, or CD9.

Several descriptions of this purportedly new approach of science are often heard in connection with large datasets and the possibilities of mobilizing crowds outside science to assists with observations and classifications. However, other accounts refer to CS as a way of democratizing science, aiding concerned communities in creating data to influence policy and as a way of promoting political decision processes involving environment and health. Objective In this study we analyse two datasets (N = 1935, N = 633) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) with the aim of giving a scientometric description of what the concept of CS entails. We account for its development over time, and what strands of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms. Results Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935), but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms has emerged for the collection and classification of data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Kullenberg","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Kasperowski","given":"Dick"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0147152","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,14]]},"language":"en","page":"e0147152","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"What Is Citizen Science? – A Scientometric Meta-Analysis","title-short":"What Is Citizen Science?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147152","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"leon2021","abstract":"Brain evolution in early Homo\nHuman brains are larger than and structurally different from the brains of the great apes. Ponce de León et al. explored the timing of the origins of the structurally modern human brain (see the Perspective by Beaudet). By comparing endocasts, representations of the inner surface of fossil brain cases, from early Homo from Africa, Georgia, and Southeast Asia, they show that these structural innovations emerged later than the first dispersal of the genus from Africa, and were probably in place by 1.7 to 1.5 million years ago. The modern humanlike brain organization emerged in cerebral regions thought to be related to toolmaking, social cognition, and language. Their findings suggest that brain reorganization was not a prerequisite for dispersals from Africa, and that there might have been more than one long-range dispersal of early Homo.\nScience, this issue p. 165; see also p. 124\nThe brains of modern humans differ from those of great apes in size, shape, and cortical organization, notably in frontal lobe areas involved in complex cognitive tasks, such as social cognition, tool use, and language. When these differences arose during human evolution is a question of ongoing debate. Here, we show that the brains of early Homo from Africa and Western Asia (Dmanisi) retained a primitive, great ape–like organization of the frontal lobe. By contrast, African Homo younger than 1.5 million years ago, as well as all Southeast Asian Homo erectus, exhibited a more derived, humanlike brain organization. Frontal lobe reorganization, once considered a hallmark of earliest Homo in Africa, thus evolved comparatively late, and long after Homo first dispersed from Africa.\nEarly Homo evolved a modern humanlike brain organization only after its first dispersal from Africa.\nEarly Homo evolved a modern humanlike brain organization only after its first dispersal from Africa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"León","given":"Marcia S.

  {"id":"li2010","abstract":"Understanding nanoparticle−protein interaction could help in promoting applications of nanoparticles in the biomedical fields and reducing/preventing possible adverse effects to the biological systems caused by nanoparticles. Quantitative measurement of the biophysical parameters of nanoparticle−protein interaction will improve such understanding, which could be conveniently performed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) as demonstrated in the present study. Two interaction situations were identified. Stable nanoparticle−protein complexes were resolved from the free nanoparticles and the proteins by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Transient complexes with fast association/dissociation rates showed distinct mobility change from the free nanoparticles in affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). Interactions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with the Fe3O4 nanoparticles (average diameters of 8 and 10 nm) and with the Au nanoparticles (average diameters of 5 and 10 nm) displayed slow and fast binding kinetics, respectively. Using the Hill equation, we could calculate the dissociation constants (KD) and cooperativity coefficients (n). Impacts on nanoparticle−protein interaction from the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the incubation buffer were evaluated on the basis of the KD and n values to interpret the interaction driving forces. Our study demonstrated the high simplicity and flexibility of CE in probing the interaction of proteins with diverse particles. The separation power of CE should also facilitate studies of the multicomponent interaction systems for investigating how adsorption onto nanoparticles could affect the protein−protein or protein−small molecule interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Ni"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Shang"},{"family":"He","given":"Le"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Wenwan"}],"container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

  {"id":"li2019","abstract":"The reasons for restricting continuous flow polymerase chain reaction (CF-PCR) microfluidic chip from lab to application are that it is not portable and requires costly external precision pumps for sample injection. Herein, we employed water as the substitute for PCR solution, and investigated the effect of the cross-section, width-to-depth ratio, and the length ratio for three temperature zones of the micro channel on the thermal and flow distribution of fluid in micro tube by finite element analysis. Results show that the central velocity is uniform and stable velocity occupies the most if the cross-section is rectangular. The deviation between predefined temperature and theoretical temperature is slight and the fluid flux is the most if width-to-depth ratio is 1:1. It is suitable for the short DNA replication if the high temperature zone Wh is larger than the low temperature zone Wl, and vice versa. Then a portable CF-PCR microfluidic chip was fabricated and an automatic sample injection system was developed. As an application, we have successfully amplified the DNA of Treponema denticola in the chip within 8 min. Such a study may offer new insight into the design of CF-PCR microfluidic chip and promote it from lab-scale research to full-scale application.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Zhenqing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yadong"},{"family":"Sekine","given":"Shinichi"},{"family":"Xi","given":"Heqi"},{"family":"Amano","given":"Atsuo"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Dawei"},{"family":"Yamaguchi","given":"Yoshinori"}],"container-title":"Biomedical Microdevices","container-title-short":"Biomed Microdevices","DOI":"10.1007/s10544-019-0457-y","ISSN":"1572-8781","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,10]]},"language":"en","page":"5","source":"Springer Link","title":"Design and fabrication of portable continuous flow PCR microfluidic chip for DNA replication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10544-019-0457-y","volume":"22"},

This behavior may have been common among megafauna that are now extinct, especially in North and South America, where megafaunal extinctions were the most severe. Lundgren et al. tested whether feral equids (horses and donkeys) reintroduced to desert regions in the North American southwest dig wells that provide ecosystem-level benefits. They found that equid-dug wells increased water availability, were used by a large number of species, and decreased distance between water sources. Abandoned wells also led to increased germination in key riparian tree species. Such equid-dug wells improve water availability, perhaps replacing a lost megafaunal function.\nScience, this issue p. 491\nMegafauna play important roles in the biosphere, yet little is known about how they shape dryland ecosystems. We report on an overlooked form of ecosystem engineering by donkeys and horses. In the deserts of North America, digging of ≤2-meter wells to groundwater by feral equids increased the density of water features, reduced distances between waters, and, at times, provided the only water present. Vertebrate richness and activity were higher at equid wells than at adjacent dry sites, and, by mimicking flood disturbance, equid wells became nurseries for riparian trees. Our results suggest that equids, even those that are introduced or feral, are able to buffer water availability, which may increase resilience to ongoing human-caused aridification.\nWell digging by donkeys and horses increases desert water availability for wider animal and plant communities.\nWell digging by donkeys and horses increases desert water availability for wider animal and plant communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Lundgren","given":"Erick J."},{"family":"Ramp","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Stromberg","given":"Juliet C."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jianguo"},{"family":"Nieto","given":"Nathan C."},{"family":"Sluk","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Moeller","given":"Karla T."},{"family":"Wallach","given":"Arian D."}],"container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.abd6775","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6541","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"language":"en","page":"491-495","PMID":"33926950","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Report","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Equids engineer desert water availability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6541/491","volume":"372"},

  {"id":"marshall2021","abstract":"Estimating dinosaur abundance\nEstimating the abundance of a species is a common practice for extant species and can reveal many aspects of its ecology, evolution, and threat level. Estimating abundance for species that are extinct, especially those long extinct, is a much trickier endeavor. Marshall et al. used a relationship established between body size and population density in extant species to estimate traits such as density, distribution, total biomass, and species persistence for one of the best-known dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex, revealing previously hidden aspects of its population ecology.\nScience, this issue p. 284\nAlthough much can be deduced from fossils alone, estimating abundance and preservation rates of extinct species requires data from living species. Here, we use the relationship between population density and body mass among living species combined with our substantial knowledge of Tyrannosaurus rex to calculate population variables and preservation rates for postjuvenile T. rex. We estimate that its abundance at any one time was ~20,000 individuals, that it persisted for ~127,000 generations, and that the total number of T. rex that ever lived was ~2.5 billion individuals, with a fossil recovery rate of 1 per ~80 million individuals or 1 per 16,000 individuals where its fossils are most abundant. The uncertainties in these values span more than two orders of magnitude, largely because of the variance in the density–body mass relationship rather than variance in the paleobiological input variables.\nRelationship between body mass and population density elucidates the potential population biology of Tyrannosaurus rex.\nRelationship between body mass and population density elucidates the potential population biology of Tyrannosaurus rex.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Marshall","given":"Charles R."},{"family":"Latorre","given":"Daniel V."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Connor J."},{"family":"Frank","given":"Tanner M."},{"family":"Magoulick","given":"Katherine M."},{"family":"Zimmt","given":"Joshua B."},{"family":"Poust","given":"Ashley W."}],"container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.abc8300","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6539","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,16]]},"language":"en","page":"284-287","PMID":"33859033","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Report","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Absolute abundance and preservation rate of Tyrannosaurus rex","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6539/284","volume":"372"},

  {"id":"martens2019","abstract":"CRISPR-Cas9 is widely used in genomic editing, but the kinetics of target search and its relation to the cellular concentration of Cas9 have remained elusive. Effective target search requires constant screening of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and a 30 ms upper limit for screening was recently found. To further quantify the rapid switching between DNA-bound and freely-diffusing states of dCas9, we developed an open-microscopy framework, the miCube, and introduce Monte-Carlo diffusion distribution analysis (MC-DDA). Our analysis reveals that dCas9 is screening PAMs 40% of the time in Gram-positive Lactoccous lactis, averaging 17 ± 4 ms per binding event. Using heterogeneous dCas9 expression, we determine the number of cellular target-containing plasmids and derive the copy number dependent Cas9 cleavage. Furthermore, we show that dCas9 is not irreversibly bound to target sites but can still interfere with plasmid replication. Taken together, our quantitative data facilitates further optimization of the CRISPR-Cas toolbox.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Martens","given":"Koen J.

  {"id":"mathieson2018","abstract":"Farming was first introduced to Europe in the mid-seventh millennium bc, and was associated with migrants from Anatolia who settled in the southeast before spreading throughout Europe. Here, to understand the dynamics of this process, we analysed genome-wide ancient DNA data from 225 individuals who lived in southeastern Europe and surrounding regions between 12000 and 500 bc. We document a west–east cline of ancestry in indigenous hunter-gatherers and, in eastern Europe, the early stages in the formation of Bronze Age steppe ancestry. We show that the first farmers of northern and western Europe dispersed through southeastern Europe with limited hunter-gatherer admixture, but that some early groups in the southeast mixed extensively with hunter-gatherers without the sex-biased admixture that prevailed later in the north and west. We also show that southeastern Europe continued to be a nexus between east and west after the arrival of farmers, with intermittent genetic contact with steppe populations occurring up to 2,000 years earlier than the migrations from the steppe that ultimately replaced much of the population of northern Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Mathieson","given":"Iain"},{"family":"Alpaslan-Roodenberg","given":"Songül"},{"family":"Posth","given":"Cosimo"},{"family":"Szécsényi-Nagy","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Rohland","given":"Nadin"},{"family":"Mallick","given":"Swapan"},{"family":"Olalde","given":"Iñigo"},{"family":"Broomandkhoshbacht","given":"Nasreen"},{"family":"Candilio","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Cheronet","given":"Olivia"},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Ferry","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Gamarra","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"Fortes","given":"Gloria González"},{"family":"Haak","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Harney","given":"Eadaoin"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Eppie"},{"family":"Keating","given":"Denise"},{"family":"Krause-Kyora","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Kucukkalipci","given":"Isil"},{"family":"Michel","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Mittnik","given":"Alissa"},{"family":"Nägele","given":"Kathrin"},{"family":"Novak","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Oppenheimer","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Pfrengle","given":"Saskia"},{"family":"Sirak","given":"Kendra"},{"family":"Stewardson","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Vai","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Alexandrov","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Alt","given":"Kurt W."},{"family":"Andreescu","given":"Radian"},{"family":"Antonović","given":"Dragana"},{"family":"Ash","given":"Abigail"},{"family":"Atanassova","given":"Nadezhda"},{"family":"Bacvarov","given":"Krum"},{"family":"Gusztáv","given":"Mende Balázs"},{"family":"Bocherens","given":"Hervé"},{"family":"Bolus","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Boroneanţ","given":"Adina"},{"family":"Boyadzhiev","given":"Yavor"},{"family":"Budnik","given":"Alicja"},{"family":"Burmaz","given":"Josip"},{"family":"Chohadzhiev","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Conard","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Cottiaux","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Čuka","given":"Maja"},{"family":"Cupillard","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Drucker","given":"Dorothée G."},{"family":"Elenski","given":"Nedko"},{"family":"Francken","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Galabova","given":"Borislava"},{"family":"Ganetsovski","given":"Georgi"},{"family":"Gély","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Hajdu","given":"Tamás"},{"family":"Handzhyiska","given":"Veneta"},{"family":"Harvati","given":"Katerina"},{"family":"Higham","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Iliev","given":"Stanislav"},{"family":"Janković","given":"Ivor"},{"family":"Karavanić","given":"Ivor"},{"family":"Kennett","given":"Douglas J."},{"family":"Komšo","given":"Darko"},{"family":"Kozak","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Labuda","given":"Damian"},{"family":"Lari","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Lazar","given":"Catalin"},{"family":"Leppek","given":"Maleen"},{"family":"Leshtakov","given":"Krassimir"},{"family":"Vetro","given":"Domenico Lo"},{"family":"Los","given":"Dženi"},{"family":"Lozanov","given":"Ivaylo"},{"family":"Malina","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Martini","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"McSweeney","given":"Kath"},{"family":"Meller","given":"Harald"},{"family":"Menđušić","given":"Marko"},{"family":"Mirea","given":"Pavel"},{"family":"Moiseyev","given":"Vyacheslav"},{"family":"Petrova","given":"Vanya"},{"family":"Price","given":"T.

I then present my views concerning the development of gender relations in Thukela Basin 7000-2000 BP hunter-gatherer society.

Given the nearly 100% efficacy of current malaria therapeutics, the primary barrier to eradication is lack of early diagnosis of the infected population. However, there are multiple strains of malaria. Although significant efforts and resources have been invested in developing antibody-based diagnostic methods for Plasmodium falciparum, a rapid and easy to use screening method capable of detecting all malaria strains has not been realized. Yet, until the entire malaria-infected population receives treatment, the disease will continue to impact society. Here, we report the development of a portable, magneto-optic technology for early stage malaria diagnosis based on the detection of the malaria pigment, hemozoin. Using β-hematin, a hemozoin mimic, we demonstrate detection limits of <0.0081 μg/mL in 500 μL of whole rabbit blood with no additional reagents required. This level corresponds to <26 parasites/μL, a full order of magnitude below clinical relevance and comparable to or less than existing technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,8]]},"archive_location":"world","author":[{"family":"McBirney","given":"Samantha E."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Dongyu"},{"family":"Scholtz","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Ameri","given":"Hossein"},{"family":"Armani","given":"Andrea M."}],"container-title":"ACS Sensors","DOI":"10.1021/acssensors.8b00269","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,21]]},"language":"en","publisher":"American Chemical Society","source":"pubs.acs.org","title":"Rapid Diagnostic for Point-of-Care Malaria Screening","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssensors.8b00269"},

University faculties are challenged with the need to develop informed NOS views in several major student subpopulations, including science majors and nonscience majors. Research into NOS views of undergraduates, particularly science majors, has been limited. In this study, NOS views of undergraduates in introductory environmental science and upper-level animal behavior courses were measured using Likert items and open-ended prompts. Analysis revealed similarities in students' views between the two courses; both populations held a mix of naïve, transitional, and moderately informed views. Comparison of pre- and postcourse mean scores revealed significant changes in NOS views only in select aspects of NOS. Student scores on sections addressing six aspects of NOS were significantly different in most cases, showing notably uninformed views of the distinctions between scientific theories and laws. Evidence-based insight into student NOS views can aid in reforming undergraduate science courses and will add to faculty and researcher understanding of the impressions of science held by undergraduates, helping educators improve scientific literacy in future scientists and diverse college graduates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Marie C.

  {"id":"moritz2019","abstract":"Increasing maturation and dissemination of easy-to-use and affordable means of digital production (e.g. 3D printing), access to these in makerspaces and FabLabs as well as powerful tools and online platforms for virtual and collaborative product design enabled the highly efficient and innovative mode of open source to spill over from software to hardware. Open source technology has enormous potential to spur innovation and enhance technological literacy and thus contribute to socioeconomic and ecological sustainability. Like in software, open source hardware (OSH) projects and online communities have evolved in a broad range of technologies and applications. In these communities, people from all over the world with diverse backgrounds (students, researchers, consumers, users etc.) gather online to jointly develop, revise, improve and freely share hardware designs and documentation. Additionally, people may build, adapt, use and sell physical artefacts based on these designs in accordance with the notion of open source. The (potential) economic impact and value of open source hardware is hard to quantify as contributors usually do not get paid and users do not necessarily buy products from vendors. Nonetheless, value is created as in the case of Linux or Wikipedia. We applied established valuation methods for open source hardware to quantify cost savings and as a result the value of an open source magnetic resonance imaging device (MRI) currently under development by the Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI2). Depending on the scenario and the valuation method, we found that savings for healthcare systems from US$1.8 million up to US$222 million per year are possible in the near future making the case for public funding and private investment in open source technology development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Moritz","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Redlich","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Günyar","given":"Süleyman"},{"family":"Winter","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Wulfsberg","given":"Jens P."}],"container-title":"Journal of Open Hardware","DOI":"10.5334/joh.14","ISSN":"2514-1708","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,20]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"2","publisher":"Ubiquity Press","source":"openhardware.metajnl.com","title":"On the Economic Value of Open Source Hardware – Case Study of an Open Source Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scanner","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.14/","volume":"3"},

UV transparent integrated waveguides launch light at a wavelength of 254 nm from a mercury lamp along the length of a 1-mm long detection cell. Transmitted UV light is collected by another waveguide in the opposite end of the detection cell, while visible fluorescence is collected vertically through the lid of the chip. The background of scattered excitation light is suppressed by detection perpendicular to the excitation, the limited UV transparency of the borosilicate lid and by choosing a PMT insensitive to the excitation light. This way, the need for a fluorescence filter is eliminated. Calibration curves were measured for serotonin, tryptophan, propranolol and acetaminophen, and separations of the four compounds were demonstrated by electrophoresis and MEKC. All compounds could be detected in the micromolar range by absorbance detection, but fluorescence detection improved detection limits for compounds displaying native UV fluorescence up to ten times. The simultaneous detection also proved useful for the identification of compounds with similar retention times and even enables accurate quantification of co-eluting compounds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Ohlsson","given":"Pelle D."},{"family":"Ordeig","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Mogensen","given":"Klaus B."},{"family":"Kutter","given":"Jörg P."}],"container-title":"ELECTROPHORESIS","container-title-short":"ELECTROPHORESIS","DOI":"10.1002/elps.200900393","ISSN":"1522-2683","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"4172-4178","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Electrophoresis microchip with integrated waveguides for simultaneous native UV fluorescence and absorbance detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elps.200900393/abstract","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"oliveira-ferreira2010","abstract":"Malaria is still a major public health problem in Brazil, with approximately 306 000 registered cases in 2009, but it is estimated that in the early 1940s, around six million cases of malaria occurred each year. As a result of the fight against the disease, the number of malaria cases decreased over the years and the smallest numbers of cases to-date were recorded in the 1960s. From the mid-1960s onwards, Brazil underwent a rapid and disorganized settlement process in the Amazon and this migratory movement led to a progressive increase in the number of reported cases. Although the main mosquito vector (Anopheles darlingi) is present in about 80% of the country, currently the incidence of malaria in Brazil is almost exclusively (99,8% of the cases) restricted to the region of the Amazon Basin, where a number of combined factors favors disease transmission and impair the use of standard control procedures. Plasmodium vivax accounts for 83,7% of registered cases, while Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for 16,3% and Plasmodium malariae is seldom observed. Although vivax malaria is thought to cause little mortality, compared to falciparum malaria, it accounts for much of the morbidity and for huge burdens on the prosperity of endemic communities. However, in the last few years a pattern of unusual clinical complications with fatal cases associated with P. vivax have been reported in Brazil and this is a matter of concern for Brazilian malariologists. In addition, the emergence of P. vivax strains resistant to chloroquine in some reports needs to be further investigated. In contrast, asymptomatic infection by P. falciparum and P. vivax has been detected in epidemiological studies in the states of Rondonia and Amazonas, indicating probably a pattern of clinical immunity in both autochthonous and migrant populations. Seropidemiological studies investigating the type of immune responses elicited in naturally-exposed populations to several malaria vaccine candidates in Brazilian populations have also been providing important information on whether immune responses specific to these antigens are generated in natural infections and their immunogenic potential as vaccine candidates. The present difficulties in reducing economic and social risk factors that determine the incidence of malaria in the Amazon Region render impracticable its elimination in the region. As a result, a malaria-integrated control effort - as a joint action on the part of the government and the population - directed towards the elimination or reduction of the risks of death or illness, is the direction adopted by the Brazilian government in the fight against the disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Oliveira-Ferreira","given":"Joseli"},{"family":"Lacerda","given":"Marcus VG"},{"family":"Brasil","given":"Patrícia"},{"family":"Ladislau","given":"José LB"},{"family":"Tauil","given":"Pedro L."},{"family":"Daniel-Ribeiro","given":"Cláudio Tadeu"}],"container-title":"Malaria Journal","container-title-short":"Malar J","DOI":"10.1186/1475-2875-9-115","ISSN":"1475-2875","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,4,30]]},"language":"en","page":"115","source":"Springer Link","title":"Malaria in Brazil: an overview","title-short":"Malaria in Brazil","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-9-115","volume":"9"},

This new method can be used to develop urinary extracellular vesicles further as a non-invasive tool for investigating human renal physiology. Abstract Exosomes are vesicles that are released from the kidney into urine. They contain protein and RNA from the glomerulus and all sections of the nephron and represent a reservoir for biomarker discovery. Current methods for the identification and quantification of urinary exosomes are time consuming and only semi-quantitative. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) counts and sizes particles by measuring their Brownian motion in solution. In this study, we applied NTA to human urine and identified particles with a range of sizes. Using antibodies against the exosomal proteins CD24 and aquaporin 2 (AQP2), conjugated to a fluorophore, we could identify a subpopulation of CD24- and AQP2-positive particles of characteristic exosomal size. Extensive pre-NTA processing of urine was not necessary. However, the intra-assay variability in the measurement of exosome concentration was significantly reduced when an ultracentrifugation step preceded NTA. Without any sample processing, NTA tracked exosomal AQP2 upregulation induced by desmopressin stimulation of kidney collecting duct cells. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was also able to track changes in exosomal AQP2 concentration that followed desmopressin treatment of mice and a patient with central diabetes insipidus. When urine was stored at room temperature, 4°C or frozen, nanoparticle concentration was reduced; freezing at −80°C with the addition of protease inhibitors produced the least reduction. In conclusion, with appropriate sample storage, NTA has potential as a tool for the characterization and quantification of extracellular vesicles in human urine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Oosthuyzen","given":"Wilna"},{"family":"Sime","given":"Nicole E.

  {"id":"pearce2015","abstract":"With the maturation of digital manufacturing technologies like 3-D printing, a new paradigm is emerging of distributed manufacturing in both scientific equipment and consumer goods. Hardware released under free licenses is known as free and open source hardware (FOSH). The availability of these FOSH designs has a large value to those with access to digital manufacturing methods and particularly for scientists with needs for highly-customized low-volume production products. It is challenging to use traditional funding models to support the necessary investment of resources in FOSH development because of the difficulty in quantifying the value of the result. In order to overcome that challenge and harvest the current opportunity in both low-cost scientific equipment and consumer products, this article evaluates the following methods to quantify the value of FOSH design including: 1) downloaded substitution valuation; 2) avoided reproduction valuation and 3) market savings valuation along with additional benefits related to market expansion, scientific innovation acceleration, educational enhancement and medical care improvement. The strengths and weaknesses of these methods are analyzed and the results show that the methods are relatively straight-forward to institute, based on reliable freely-available data, and that they minimize assumptions. A case study of a syringe pump with numerous scientific and medical applications is presented. The results found millions of dollars of economic value from a relatively simple scientific device being released under open-licenses representing orders of magnitude increase in value from conventional proprietary development. The inescapable conclusion of this study is that FOSH development should be funded by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments particularly in technologies associated with science, medicine and education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearce","given":"Joshua M."}],"container-title":"Modern Economy","DOI":"10.4236/me.2015.61001","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,12]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"1-11","publisher":"Scientific Research Publishing","source":"scirp.org","title":"Quantifying the Value of Open Source Hard-ware Development","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.scirp.org/Journal/Paperabs.aspx?paperid=53076","volume":"6"},

Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87% compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89% for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92% for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94% for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH. Policies were outlined that provide nations with a template for strategically harvesting the opportunities provided by the free and open source paradigm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearce","given":"Joshua M."}],"container-title":"HardwareX","container-title-short":"HardwareX","DOI":"10.1016/j.ohx.2020.e00139","ISSN":"2468-0672","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e00139","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Economic savings for scientific free and open source technology: A review","title-short":"Economic savings for scientific free and open source technology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067220300481","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"pedrioli2021","abstract":"The use of extracellular vesicles as cell-free therapy is a promising approach currently investigated in several disease models. The intrinsic capacity of extracellular vesicles to encapsulate macromolecules within their lipid bilayer membrane-bound lumen is a characteristic exploited in drug delivery to transport active pharmaceutical ingredients. Besides their role as biological nanocarriers, extracellular vesicles have a specific tropism towards target cells, which is a key aspect in precision medicine. However, the little knowledge of the mechanisms governing the release of a cargo macromolecule in recipient cells and the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade scale-up manufacturing of extracellular vesicles are currently slowing their application as drug delivery nanocarriers. In this review, we summarize, from a cell biologist’s perspective, the main evidence supporting the role of extracellular vesicles as promising carriers in drug delivery, and we report five key considerations that merit further investigation before translating Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) to clinical applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pedrioli","given":"Giona"},{"family":"Piovesana","given":"Ester"},{"family":"Vacchi","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Balbi","given":"Carolina"}],"container-title":"Biology","DOI":"10.3390/biology10050376","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5]]},"language":"en","number":"5","page":"376","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Extracellular Vesicles as Promising Carriers in Drug Delivery: Considerations from a Cell Biologist’s Perspective","title-short":"Extracellular Vesicles as Promising Carriers in Drug Delivery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/10/5/376","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"peruzzotti-jametti2021","abstract":"Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation induces recovery in animal models of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Although the replacement of lost endogenous cells was originally proposed as the primary healing mechanism of NSC grafts, it is now clear that transplanted NSCs operate via multiple mechanisms, including the horizontal exchange of therapeutic cargoes to host cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are membrane particles trafficking nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites and metabolic enzymes, lipids, and entire organelles. However, the function and the contribution of these cargoes to the broad therapeutic effects of NSCs are yet to be fully understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an established feature of several inflammatory and degenerative CNS disorders, most of which are potentially treatable with exogenous stem cell therapeutics. Herein, we investigated the hypothesis that NSCs release and traffic functional mitochondria via EVs to restore mitochondrial function in target cells. Untargeted proteomics revealed a significant enrichment of mitochondrial proteins spontaneously released by NSCs in EVs. Morphological and functional analyses confirmed the presence of ultrastructurally intact mitochondria within EVs with conserved membrane potential and respiration. We found that the transfer of these mitochondria from EVs to mtDNA-deficient L929 Rho0 cells rescued mitochondrial function and increased Rho0 cell survival. Furthermore, the incorporation of mitochondria from EVs into inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes restored normal mitochondrial dynamics and cellular metabolism and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in target cells. When transplanted in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, exogenous NSCs actively transferred mitochondria to mononuclear phagocytes and induced a significant amelioration of clinical deficits. Our data provide the first evidence that NSCs deliver functional mitochondria to target cells via EVs, paving the way for the development of novel (a)cellular approaches aimed at restoring mitochondrial dysfunction not only in multiple sclerosis, but also in degenerative neurological diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Peruzzotti-Jametti","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Bernstock","given":"Joshua D."},{"family":"Willis","given":"Cory M."},{"family":"Manferrari","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Rogall","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Fernandez-Vizarra","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Williamson","given":"James C."},{"family":"Braga","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Bosch","given":"Aletta","dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Leonardi","given":"Tommaso"},{"family":"Krzak","given":"Grzegorz"},{"family":"Kittel","given":"Ágnes"},{"family":"Benincá","given":"Cristiane"},{"family":"Vicario","given":"Nunzio"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Sisareuth"},{"family":"Bastos","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Bicci","given":"Iacopo"},{"family":"Iraci","given":"Nunzio"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Jayden A."},{"family":"Peacock","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Muller","given":"Karin H."},{"family":"Lehner","given":"Paul J."},{"family":"Buzas","given":"Edit Iren"},{"family":"Faria","given":"Nuno"},{"family":"Zeviani","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Frezza","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Brisson","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Matheson","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Viscomi","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Pluchino","given":"Stefano"}],"container-title":"PLOS Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.3001166","ISSN":"1545-7885","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,7]]},"language":"en","page":"e3001166","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Neural stem cells traffic functional mitochondria via extracellular vesicles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001166","volume":"19"},

It aims to provide more than a simplified qualitative description of the subject, without getting bogged down in difficult mathematics. Each chapter contains exercises, ranging from straightforward ones to more involved problems, addressing instances from (thermal motion in) chemistry, physics and life sciences. Exercises also deal with derivations or calculations that are skipped in the main text.

  {"id":"pol2014","abstract":"Background Enumeration of extracellular vesicles has clinical potential as a biomarker for disease. In biological samples, the smallest and largest vesicles typically differ 25-fold in size, 300 000-fold in concentration, 20 000-fold in volume, and 10 000 000-fold in scattered light. Because of this heterogeneity, the currently employed techniques detect concentrations ranging from 104 to 1012 vesicles mL–1. Objectives To investigate whether the large variation in the detected concentration of vesicles is caused by the minimum detectable vesicle size of five widely used techniques. Methods The size and concentration of vesicles and reference beads were measured with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a conventional flow cytometer, a flow cytometer dedicated to detecting submicrometer particles, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and resistive pulse sensing (RPS). Results Each technique gave a different size distribution and a different concentration for the same vesicle sample. Conclusion Differences between the detected vesicle concentrations are primarily caused by differences between the minimum detectable vesicle sizes. The minimum detectable vesicle sizes were 70–90 nm for NTA, 70–100 nm for RPS, 150–190 nm for dedicated flow cytometry, and 270–600 nm for conventional flow cytometry. TEM could detect the smallest vesicles present, albeit after adhesion on a surface. Dedicated flow cytometry was most accurate in determining the size of reference beads, but is expected to be less accurate on vesicles, owing to heterogeneity of the refractive index of vesicles. Nevertheless, dedicated flow cytometry is relatively fast and allows multiplex fluorescence detection, making it most applicable to clinical research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pol","given":"E.","dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Coumans","given":"F. a.

  {"id":"redish","abstract":"In this chapter we describe an interactive method of teaching, Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE), that helps students learn physics by engaging in processes that mirror the activities of physicists when they construct and apply knowledge. These processes involve observing, finding patterns, building and testing explanations of the patterns, and using multiple representations to reason about physical phenomena. ISLE is a comprehensive learning system that provides a general philosophy and specific activities that can be used in “lectures” (interactive meetings where students construct and test ideas), recitations (where students learn to represent them in multiple ways while solving problems) and labs (where students learn to design their own experiments to test hypotheses and solve practical problems). In ISLE, students are assessed for conceptual understanding, for problem-solving ability, and, most importantly, for their use of various scientific abilities. We have developed activities that help students acquire some of the abilities used by scientists in their work: experiment design, model building, use of multiple-representations, evaluation, etc. To determine the degree to which the students have acquired these abilities and to simultaneously provide feedback to the students, we have developed a set of rubrics that can be used by instructors for grading and by the students for self assessment. In this chapter we also provide a theoretical basis for the ISLE structure (using brain and cognitive research), explain how this learning system addresses the needs of the 21st century science education and workplace, and how it is different from other reformed curricula.","author":[{"family":"Redish","given":"Edward"}],"language":"en","page":"48","source":"Zotero","title":"Investigative Science Learning Environment –","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"sayes","abstract":"A key element of any nanomaterial toxicity screening strategy is a detailed and comprehensive physicochemical characterization of the test material being studied. This is a critical factor for correlating the nanoparticle surface characteristics with any measured biological/toxicological responses, as well as to provide an adequate reference point for comparing toxicity results with the hazard-based findings of other investigators. Moreover, when hazard or risk-based evaluations are made on a particular nanomaterial (based on a variety of studies), it is important to ensure that the nanoparticle-types are identical or very similar in composition. This can only be accomplished if rigorous characterization is conducted. In the absence of an adequate assessment of the physical characteristics, it is easy to draw general conclusions on nanoparticle-types which may have similar chemical compositions but, in fact, have different sizes, shapes, crystal structures, surface coatings, and surface reactivity characteristics. The determination of nanomaterial physicochemical properties is vitally important to nanomedicinal applications in that the fate, accumulation, and transport of nanomaterials through the body over time may be predicted based on specific surface characteristics.

In our method, electrodes are capacitively-coupled to a fluidic channel through dielectric barriers; the application of a high-frequency electric field to these electrodes then induces an electric field in the channel. This technique combines the cell manipulation abilities of traditional DEP with the ease of fabrication found in insulator-based technologies. A microfluidic device was fabricated based on this principle to determine the feasibility of cell manipulations through contactless DEP (cDEP). We were able to demonstrate cell responses unique to the DEP effect in three separate cell lines.

  {"id":"shortreed2000","abstract":"In electrophoresis, the migration velocity is used for sizing DNA and proteins or for distinguishing molecules based on charge and hydrodynamic radius. Many protein and DNA assays relevant to disease diagnosis are based on such separations. However, standard protocols are not only slow (minutes to hours) but also insensitive (many molecules in a detectable band). We successfully demonstrated a high-throughput imaging approach that allows determination of the individual electrophoretic mobilities of many molecules at a time. Each measurement only requires a few milliseconds to complete. This opens up the possibility of screening single copies of DNA or proteins within single biological cells for disease markers without performing polymerase chain reaction or other biological amplification. The purpose is not to separate the DNA molecules but to identify each one on the basis of the measured electrophoretic mobility. We developed three different procedures to measure the individual molecular mobilities. The results correlate well with capillary electrophoresis (CE) experiments for the same samples (2−49 kb dsDNA) under identical separation conditions. The implication is that any electrophoresis protocols from slab gels to CE should be adaptable to single-molecule screening for disease diagnosis.","author":[{"family":"Shortreed","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Li","given":"Hanlin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Wei-Hua"},{"family":"Yeung","given":"Edward S."}],"container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

  {"id":"sprajc2021","abstract":"In the 1920s, during the first archaeological excavations at Uaxactún, Petén, Guatemala, an architectural complex named Group E was interpreted as an ancient Maya astronomical observatory, intended specifically for sighting the equinoctial and solstitial sunrises. In the following decades, a large number of architectural compounds with the same configuration have been found, most of them in the central lowlands of the Yucatan peninsula. The multiple hypotheses that have been proposed about the astronomical function of these complexes, commonly designated as E Groups, range from those attributing them a paramount role in astronomical observations to those that consider them merely allegorical or commemorative allusions to celestial cycles, without any observational use. This study, based on quantitative analyses of a reasonably large sample of alignment data, as well as on contextual evidence, shows that many of the previous hypotheses cannot be sustained. I argue that E Groups, although built primarily for ritual purposes, were astronomically functional, but also that they had no specific or particularly prominent role in astronomical observations. Their orientations belong to widespread alignment groups, mostly materialized in buildings of other types and explicable in terms of some fundamental concerns of the agriculturally-based Maya societies. I present the evidence demonstrating that the astronomical orientations initially embedded in E Groups, which represent the earliest standardized form of Maya monumental architecture and whose occurrence in practically all early cities in the central Yucatan peninsula attests to their socio-political significance, were later transferred to buildings and compounds of other types. Therefore, it is precisely the importance of the astronomically and cosmologically significant directions, first incorporated in E Groups, that allows us to understand some prominent aspects of ancient Maya architecture and urbanism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Šprajc","given":"Ivan"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0250785","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,27]]},"language":"en","page":"e0250785","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Astronomical aspects of Group E-type complexes and implications for understanding ancient Maya architecture and urban planning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250785","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"steed2021","abstract":"The daily rhythms of agriculture\nSunlight drives agriculture, and plant circadian rhythms tune the plant's response to daily light-dark cycles. Steed et al. discuss how agricultural productivity might be improved by consideration of how the plant's circadian rhythm alters plant responses to the challenges posed by its environment.\nScience, this issue p. eabc9141\nStructured Abstract\nBACKGROUNDGlobal population growth, increased meat consumption, and concerns about sustainability of resources are driving forces for future agriculture to produce higher yields with reduced inputs. Studies, mostly performed in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, demonstrate that the circadian clock, which is a 24-hour oscillator that is an adaptation to living on a rotating planet, has profound effects on the physiology and development of plants. The circadian system contributes to the regulation of flowering, biomass, photosynthesis, water use, temperature stress responses, and pathogen defenses, which are important yield components in plant crops.\nADVANCESCircadian timing in plants is controlled by circadian oscillators in every cell. These oscillators contain pathways of regulation with high degrees of feedback between transcriptional regulators that are expressed in a temporal series through the day and night cycle. The genetic architecture of these circadian oscillators has been largely solved in plants, animals, and fungi during the last quarter-century. This has revealed a plant-specific set of circadian oscillator genes that are common between the major crops. Genome sequencing of crop plants and genetic mapping studies have demonstrated that agricultural breeding has selected for allelic variants in circadian genes, particularly for agricultural modification of the time to flowering. At the same time, indoor crop growth in controlled environments has expanded opportunities to improve agriculture by simultaneously engineering the external environmental cycles and the internal circadian cycles of crops. This knowledge of the genetic structure of the circadian system; the discoveries that the plant circadian oscillators regulate a swathe of plant physiology, metabolism, and gene expression; and improved genetic tools mean that it is now possible to consider translational research that aims to use the circadian system as an approach to improve crop yield and reduce inputs.\nOUTLOOKCircadian biology might have translational impact in crop science through the practice of “chronoculture,” in which the daily timing of agronomic interventions and the genetic basis of circadian rhythms are targets for crop improvements and reduced inputs. In the short term, this would include the use of automation for round-the-clock monitoring and control of plant crop growth and health. Drones and low-cost single-board computers can capture high-frequency data about rhythms of photosynthesis, gas exchange, water use, stomatal movements, and growth of crops in the field to inform mechanistic and agronomic models of crop growth. Experiments in model systems have demonstrated daily rhythms in the responsiveness of plants to temperature, water, pests, and herbicides. With additional data from studies in crop species on the farm, it might be possible to develop new agronomic approaches in which interventions with nutrients, chemicals, light, and temperature are applied at the time when they are most effective. Breeding new germplasm with greater variation at circadian alleles might contribute to improved growth and sustainability. In the future, gene editing and transgenic approaches could be used to engineer crops. For example, plants with slow-running circadian clocks might be better adapted to high-latitude summers. New tissue-specific gene expression strategies that allow temporal and spatial control of transgene expression represent long-term targets for engineering crops with optimized traits. For example, alteration of circadian function specifically in phloem companion cells could be used to engineer new flowering-time traits without affecting other circadian outputs. By using split protein approaches, it should be possible to express proteins at specific times of day in desired tissues to confer stress tolerance or produce bioproducts for harvest, with less negative effects than constitutive expression. Breeding and transgene approaches are expensive because they are long-term programs subject to regulatory scrutiny. Consequently, there is a need for increased fundamental research and applied agronomic studies investigating the basic mechanism and applied uses of circadian biology in agriculture. Major goals of chronoculture research will be measuring, in the major crops in the field, the impact of the circadian oscillator on yield-relevant traits and quantifying the effect of time of day on agronomic treatments. <img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/372/6541/eabc9141/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Wheat growing in day and night cycles of light and dark and warm and cold.In the light (left), plants photosynthesize, fixing carbon for growth and the production of transient reserves of sugars. At night (right), plants consume stored sugars. Circadian clocks anticipate these environmental cycles and regulate most plant biology.CREDIT: KELLIE HOLOSKI/SCIENCE\nHuman health is dependent on a plentiful and nutritious supply of food, primarily derived from crop plants. Rhythmic supply of light as a result of the day and night cycle led to the evolution of circadian clocks that modulate most plant physiology, photosynthesis, metabolism, and development. To regulate crop traits and adaptation, breeders have indirectly selected for variation at circadian genes. The pervasive impact of the circadian system on crops suggests that future food production might be improved by modifying circadian rhythms, engineering the timing of transgene expression, and applying agricultural treatments at the most effective time of day. We describe the applied research required to take advantage of circadian biology in agriculture to increase production and reduce inputs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Steed","given":"Gareth"},{"family":"Ramirez","given":"Dora Cano"},{"family":"Hannah","given":"Matthew A."},{"family":"Webb","given":"Alex A.

  {"id":"tian2018","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have stimulated considerable scientific and clinical interest, yet protein profiling and sizing of individual EVs remains challenging due to their small particle size, low abundance of proteins, and overall heterogeneity. Building upon a laboratory-built high-sensitivity flow cytometer (HSFCM), we report here a rapid approach for quantitative multiparameter analysis of single EVs down to 40 nm with an analysis rate up to 10 000 particles per minute. Statistically robust particle size distribution was acquired in minutes with a resolution and profile well matched with those of cryo-TEM measurements. Subpopulations of EVs expressing CD9, CD63, and/or CD81 were quantified upon immunofluorescent staining. When HSFCM was used to analyze blood samples, a significantly elevated level of CD147-positive EVs was identified in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). HSFCM provides a sensitive and rapid platform for surface protein profiling and sizing of individual EVs, which could greatly aid the understanding of EV-mediated intercellular communication and the development of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Tian","given":"Ye"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Manfei"},{"family":"Su","given":"Guoqiang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Shaobin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wenqiang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhibin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Chaoxiang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Lihong"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Lina"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Xiaomei"}],"container-title":"ACS Nano","container-title-short":"ACS Nano","DOI":"10.1021/acsnano.7b07782","ISSN":"1936-0851","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,23]]},"page":"671-680","publisher":"American Chemical Society","source":"ACS Publications","title":"Protein Profiling and Sizing of Extracellular Vesicles from Colorectal Cancer Patients via Flow Cytometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.7b07782","volume":"12"},

This process of cumulative cultural evolution underlies human cultural success and has enabled us to reach and inhabit some of the most inhospitable environments on this planet. Why humans, but not other animals, have exhibited a cultural explosion has caused much deliberation. The human propensity to imitate, teach, “mind-read” and cooperate have all featured prominently in accounts of the prerequisites for cumulative culture.

  {"id":"vandergrein2019","abstract":"Several naked virus species, including members of the Picornaviridae family, have recently been described to escape their host cells and spread infection via enclosure in extracellular vesicles (EV). EV are 50–300 nm sized lipid membrane-enclosed particles produced by all cells that are broadly recognized for playing regulatory roles in numerous (patho)physiological processes, including viral infection. Both pro- and antiviral functions have been ascribed to EV released by virus-infected cells. It is currently not known whether this reported functional diversity is a result of the release of multiple virus-containing and non-virus containing EV subpopulations that differ in composition and function. Using encephalomyocarditis virus infection (EMCV, Picornaviridae family), we here provide evidence that EV populations released by infected cells are highly heterogeneous. Virus was contained in two distinct EV populations that differed in physical characteristics, such as sedimentation properties, and in enrichment for proteins indicative of different EV biogenesis pathways, such as the plasma membrane resident proteins Flotillin-1 and CD9, and the autophagy regulatory protein LC3. Additional levels of EV heterogeneity were identified using high-resolution flow cytometric analysis of single EV. Importantly, we demonstrate that EV subsets released during EMCV infection varied largely in potency of transferring virus infection and in their kinetics of release from infected cells. These data support the notion that heterogeneous EV populations released by virus-infected cells can exert diverse functions at distinct time points during infection. Unraveling the compositional, temporal and functional heterogeneity of these EV populations using single EV analysis technologies, as employed in this study, is vital to understanding the role of EV in virus dissemination and antiviral host responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Grein","given":"Susanne G.","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Defourny","given":"Kyra A.

  {"id":"vantricht2017","abstract":"During development of adenovirus-based vaccines, samples have to be analyzed in order to either monitor the production process or control the quality and safety of the product. An important quality attribute is the total concentration of intact adenoviruses, which currently is determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or anion exchange-HPLC. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) was evaluated as alternative to the current methods with the aim to have one single method that allows reliable and fast quantiﬁcation of adenovirus particles throughout the full process. Intact adenoviruses samples from downstream processing and upstream processing were analyzed directly by CE with UV-detection at 214 nm. Only the samples with high amounts of DNA required a simple sample pretreatment by benzonase. Adenovirus particles were separated from matrix components such as cell debris, residual cell DNA, and/or proteins on a PVA-coated capillary using a BGE consisting of 125 mM Tris, 338 mM tricine and 0.2% v/v polysorbate-20 at pH 7.7. Full factorial design of experiments was used for method optimization as part of the analytical quality by design (AQbD) method development approach. The method was validated for the quantiﬁcation of adenoviruses on ﬁve representative samples from the manufacturing process in the range of 0.5×1011–1.5×1011 adenovirus particles per ml (~80 to 250 pmol/l). The CE method showed intermediate precision of 7.8% RSD on concentration and an accuracy (spiked recovery) of 95–110%. CE proved highly useful for process development support and is being implemented for in-process control testing for adenovirus vaccine manufacturing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Tricht","given":"Ewoud","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Geurink","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Backus","given":"Harold"},{"family":"Germano","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Somsen","given":"Govert W."},{"family":"Sänger–van de Griend","given":"Cari E."}],"container-title":"Talanta","DOI":"10.1016/j.talanta.2017.01.013","ISSN":"00399140","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5]]},"language":"en","page":"8-14","source":"Crossref","title":"One single, fast and robust capillary electrophoresis method for the direct quantification of intact adenovirus particles in upstream and downstream processing samples","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039914017300140","volume":"166"},

  {"id":"wang2020","abstract":"By virtue of the well-developed micro- and nanofabrication technologies and rapidly progressing surface functionalization strategies, silicon-based devices have been widely recognized as a highly promising platform for the next-generation lab-on-a-chip bioanalytical systems with a great potential for point-of-care medical diagnostics. Herein, an overview of the latest advances in silicon-based integrated optofluidic label-free biosensing technologies relying on the efficient interactions between the evanescent light field at the functionalized surface and specifically bound analytes is presented. State-of-the-art technologies demonstrating label-free evanescent wave-based biomarker detection mainly encompass three device configurations, including on-chip waveguide-based interferometers, microring resonators, and photonic-crystal-based cavities. Moreover, up-to-date strategies for elevating the sensitivities and also simplifying the sensing processes are discussed.

Here, we present a method for the tracking of features that partially overlap, in order to be able to track so-called colloidal molecules. Our approach implements two improvements into existing particle tracking algorithms. Firstly, we use the history of previously identified feature locations to successfully find their positions in consecutive frames. Secondly, we present a framework for non-linear least-squares fitting to summed radial model functions and analyze the accuracy (bias) and precision (random error) of the method on artificial data. We find that our tracking algorithm correctly identifies overlapping features with an accuracy below 0.2% of the feature radius and a precision of 0.1 to 0.01 pixels for a typical image of a colloidal cluster. Finally, we use our method to extract the three-dimensional diffusion tensor from the Brownian motion of colloidal dimers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wel","given":"Casper","dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Kraft","given":"Daniela J."}],"container-title":"Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"wolos2020","abstract":"Mapping primordial reaction networks\nChemists seeking to understand the origins of life have published a wide range of reactions that may have yielded the building blocks of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids from simple precursors. Wołos et al. scoured the literature to document each such reaction class and then wrote software that applied the reactions first to the simplest compounds such as cyanide, water, and ammonia, and then iteratively to each successive generation of products. The resulting network predicted a variety of previously unappreciated routes to biochemically relevant compounds, several of which the authors validated experimentally.\nScience, this issue p. eaaw1955\nStructured Abstract\nINTRODUCTIONAlthough hundreds of organic reactions have been validated under consensus prebiotic conditions, we still have only a fragmentary understanding of how these individual steps combined into complete synthetic pathways to generate life’s building blocks, which other abiotic molecules might have also formed, how independent reactions gave rise to chemical systems, and how membranes encapsulating these systems came into being. Answering such questions requires consideration of very large numbers of possible synthetic pathways. Starting with even a few primordial substrates—e.g., H2O, N2, HCN, NH3, CH4, and H2S—the number of prebiotically synthesizable molecules grows rapidly into the tens of thousands. Detailed analysis of this space and its synthetic connectivity may be beyond the cognition of individual chemists but can be performed by smart computer algorithms.\nRATIONALEWe harnessed the power of computer-assisted organic synthesis to map the network of molecules that are synthesizable from basic prebiotic feedstocks. This was done by encoding currently known prebiotic reactions in a machine-readable format, augmenting these reaction transforms with information about incompatible groups and reaction conditions, and then applying them iteratively to a set of basic prebiotic substrates. The reaction network thus created was queried by algorithms to identify complete synthetic routes as well as those tracing reaction systems—notably, reaction cycles. All calculations were supported by a software application that is freely available to the scientific community.\nRESULTSWe demonstrate that this network comprises more abiotic molecules than biotic molecules. The biotic compounds differ from the abiotic compounds in several ways: They are more hydrophilic, more thermodynamically stable, and more balanced in terms of the hydrogen bond donors and acceptors they contain and are synthesizable along routes with fewer changes of conditions. The network contains not only all known syntheses of biotic compounds but also previously unidentified routes, several of which (e.g., prebiotic syntheses of acetaldehyde and diglycine, as well as malic, fumaric, citric, and uric acids) we validated by experiment. We also demonstrate three notable forms of chemical emergence: (i) that the molecules created within the network can themselves enable new types of prebiotic reactions; (ii) that within just a few synthetic generations, simple chemical systems (including self-regenerating cycles) begin to emerge; and (iii) that the network contains prebiotic routes to surfactant species, thus outlining a path to biological compartmentalization. We support these conclusions with experimental results, establishing previously undescribed prebiotic reactions and entire reaction systems—notably, a self-regenerating cycle of iminodiacetic acid.\nCONCLUSIONComputer-generated reaction networks are useful in identifying synthetic routes to prebiotically relevant targets and are indispensable for the discovery of prebiotic chemical systems that are otherwise challenging to discern. As our network continues to grow by means of crowd-sourcing of newly validated prebiotic reactions, it will allow continued simulation of chemical genesis, beginning with molecules as simple as water, ammonia, and methane and leading to increasingly complex targets, including those of current interest in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. <img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/369/6511/eaaw1955/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Network of prebiotic chemistry.Computer simulation of plausible prebiotic reactions creates a network of molecules that are synthesizable from prebiotic feedstocks and establishes multiple unreported—but now experimentally validated—syntheses of prebiotic targets as well as self-regenerating cycles. In this schematic illustration, light blue nodes represent abiotic molecules, dark blue nodes represent molecules along newly discovered prebiotic syntheses of uric and citric acids, and red nodes represent other biotic molecules.\nThe challenge of prebiotic chemistry is to trace the syntheses of life’s key building blocks from a handful of primordial substrates. Here we report a forward-synthesis algorithm that generates a full network of prebiotic chemical reactions accessible from these substrates under generally accepted conditions. This network contains both reported and previously unidentified routes to biotic targets, as well as plausible syntheses of abiotic molecules. It also exhibits three forms of nontrivial chemical emergence, as the molecules within the network can act as catalysts of downstream reaction types; form functional chemical systems, including self-regenerating cycles; and produce surfactants relevant to primitive forms of biological compartmentalization. To support these claims, computer-predicted, prebiotic syntheses of several biotic molecules as well as a multistep, self-regenerative cycle of iminodiacetic acid were validated by experiment.\nSoftware predicts successively more complex products from iterative prebiotically plausible reactions of simpler precursors.\nSoftware predicts successively more complex products from iterative prebiotically plausible reactions of simpler precursors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Wołos","given":"Agnieszka"},{"family":"Roszak","given":"Rafał"},{"family":"Żądło-Dobrowolska","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Beker","given":"Wiktor"},{"family":"Mikulak-Klucznik","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Spólnik","given":"Grzegorz"},{"family":"Dygas","given":"Mirosław"},{"family":"Szymkuć","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Grzybowski","given":"Bartosz A."}],"container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aaw1955","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6511","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,25]]},"language":"en","PMID":"32973002","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Synthetic connectivity, emergence, and self-regeneration in the network of prebiotic chemistry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6511/eaaw1955","volume":"369"},

We find that the electrophoretic mobility of nanoparticles in 100-nm channels is lower than in larger channels or in bulk, presumably due to hindrance effects. Furthermore, we notice a non-intuitive increase in mobility with buffer concentration, which we attribute to electric double layer interactions. Finally, since the evanescent field intensity decreases with distance from the channel wall, we use the measured fluorescence intensity to report probable transverse distributions of free-solution 42-nm polystyrene fluorescent particles.

  {"id":"zada2018","abstract":"The abundance of plastic products in modern society has resulted in a proliferation of small plastic particles called “microplastics” in the global environment. Currently, spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier‐transform infrared and spontaneous (i.e., conventional) Raman spectroscopy are widely employed for the identification of the plastic microparticles, but these are rather time consuming. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, based on the coherent interaction of 2 different laser beams with vibrational levels in the molecules of the sample, would enable much faster detection and identification of microplastics. Here, we present for the first time an SRS‐based method for identifying 5 different high production‐volume polymer types in microplastics extracted from environmental or consumer product samples. The particles from the extracts were collected on a flat alumina filter, and 6 SRS images were acquired at specifically chosen wavenumbers. Next, we decomposed these spectral data into specific images for the 5 polymers selected for calibration. We tested the approach on an artificial mixture of plastic particles and determined the signal‐to‐noise and level of cross talk for the 5 polymer types. As a proof of principle, we identified polyethylene terephthalate particles extracted from a commercial personal care product, demonstrating also the thousand‐fold higher speed of mapping with SRS compared with conventional Raman. Furthermore, after density separation of a Rhine estuary sediment sample, we scanned 1 cm2 of the filter surface in less than 5 hr and detected and identified 88 microplastics, which corresponds to 12,000 particles per kilogram dry weight. We conclude that SRS can be an efficient method for monitoring microplastics in the environment and potentially many other matrices of interest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zada","given":"Liron"},{"family":"Leslie","given":"Heather A."},{"family":"Vethaak","given":"A.

  {"id":"zhu2012","abstract":"Prior to the evolution of complex biochemical machinery, the growth and division of simple primitive cells (protocells) must have been driven by environmental factors. We have previously demonstrated two pathways for fatty acid vesicle growth in which initially spherical vesicles grow into long filamentous vesicles; division is then mediated by fluid shear forces. Here we describe a different pathway for division that is independent of external mechanical forces. We show that the illumination of filamentous fatty acid vesicles containing either a fluorescent dye in the encapsulated aqueous phase, or hydroxypyrene in the membrane, rapidly induces pearling and subsequent division in the presence of thiols. The mechanism of this photochemically driven pathway most likely involves the generation of reactive oxygen species, which oxidize thiols to disulfide-containing compounds that associate with fatty acid membranes, inducing a change in surface tension and causing pearling and subsequent division. This vesicle division pathway provides an alternative route for the emergence of early self-replicating cell-like structures, particularly in thiol-rich surface environments where UV-absorbing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) could have facilitated protocell division. The subsequent evolution of cellular metabolic processes controlling the thiol:disulfide redox state would have enabled autonomous cellular control of the timing of cell division, a major step in the origin of cellular life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Ting F."},{"family":"Adamala","given":"Katarzyna"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Na"},{"family":"Szostak","given":"Jack W."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1203212109","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"25","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,19]]},"language":"en","page":"9828-9832","PMID":"22665773","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Photochemically driven redox chemistry induces protocell membrane pearling and division","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/109/25/9828","volume":"109"},
