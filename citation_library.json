  {"id":"1949","abstract":"ECONOMIC and material loss through corrosion of metals is divided into (a) direct loss resulting from protection costs and replacement of corroded equipment and (b) an incalculable, often higher, indirect loss through shutdown, over-design, loss of product and efficiency, explosion, and contamination. Direct loss by corrosion, although amenable to analysis, still is difficult to estimate. A survey of this kind is almost always incomplete and is subject to a wide range of interpretation. Nevertheless, it is believed that annual cost to the United States, tabulated later in detail and amounting to over $5,500 million, represents the present-day tax exacted directly by the ravages of corrosion and is the correct order of magnitude. Previous estimates in the order of $500 million to $1,000 million dollars are definitely too low. Not all of the material loss can be prevented. Metals persist in reverting to their ores or to compounds of lower energy despite corrosion protection; and ...","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,29]]},"citation-key":"1949","container-title":"Chemical & Engineering News Archive","container-title-short":"Chem.

  {"id":"adams2021","abstract":"Improving objects, ideas or situations—whether a designer seeks to advance technology, a writer seeks to strengthen an argument or a manager seeks to encourage desired behaviour—requires a mental search for possible changes1–3. We investigated whether people are as likely to consider changes that subtract components from an object, idea or situation as they are to consider changes that add new components. People typically consider a limited number of promising ideas in order to manage the cognitive burden of searching through all possible ideas, but this can lead them to accept adequate solutions without considering potentially superior alternatives4–10. Here we show that people systematically default to searching for additive transformations, and consequently overlook subtractive transformations. Across eight experiments, participants were less likely to identify advantageous subtractive changes when the task did not (versus did) cue them to consider subtraction, when they had only one opportunity (versus several) to recognize the shortcomings of an additive search strategy or when they were under a higher (versus lower) cognitive load. Defaulting to searches for additive changes may be one reason that people struggle to mitigate overburdened schedules11, institutional red tape12 and damaging effects on the planet13,14. Observational and experimental studies of people seeking to improve objects, ideas or situations demonstrate that people default to searching for solutions that add new components rather than for solutions that remove existing components.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Adams","given":"Gabrielle S."},{"family":"Converse","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Hales","given":"Andrew H."},{"family":"Klotz","given":"Leidy E."}],"citation-key":"adams2021","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03380-y","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7853","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","number":"7853","page":"258-261","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"People systematically overlook subtractive changes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03380-y","volume":"592"},
  {"id":"adegoke2021","abstract":"New point-of-care diagnostic approaches for malaria that are sensitive to low parasitemia, easy to use in a field setting, and affordable are urgently required to meet the World Health Organization’s objective of reducing malaria cases and related life losses by 90% globally on or before 2030. In this study, an inexpensive “matchbox size” near-infrared (NIR) spectrophotometer was used for the first time to detect and quantify malaria infection in vitro from isolated dried red blood cells using a fingerpick volume of blood. This the first study to apply a miniaturized NIR device to diagnose a parasitic infection and identify marker bands indicative of malaria infection in the NIR region. An NIR device has many advantages including wavelength accuracy and repeatability, speed, resolution, and a greatly improved signal-to-noise ratio compared to existing spectroscopic options. Using multivariate data analysis, we discriminated control red blood cells from infected cells and established the limit of detection of the technique. Principal component analysis displayed a good separation between the infected and uninfected RBCs, while partial least-squares regression analysis yielded a robust parasitemia prediction with root-mean-square error of prediction values of 0.446 and 0.001% for the higher and lower parasitemia models, respectively. The R2 values of the higher and lower parasitemia models were 0.947 and 0.931, respectively. Finally, an estimated parasitemia detection limit of 0.00001% and a qunatification limit of 0.001% was achieved; to ascertain the true efficacy of the technique for point-of-care screening, clinical studies using large patient numbers are required, which is the subject of future studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Adegoke","given":"John A."},{"family":"Kochan","given":"Kamila"},{"family":"Heraud","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Bayden R."}],"citation-key":"adegoke2021","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

These include novel loci for scalp hair shape and balding, and the first reported loci for hair greying, monobrow, eyebrow and beard thickness. A newly identified locus influencing hair shape includes a Q30R substitution in the Protease Serine S1 family member 53 (PRSS53). We demonstrate that this enzyme is highly expressed in the hair follicle, especially the inner root sheath, and that the Q30R substitution affects enzyme processing and secretion.

  {"id":"albert-smet2019","abstract":"Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has been present in cell biology laboratories for quite some time, mainly as custom-made systems, with imaging applications ranging from single cells (in the micrometer scale) to small organisms (in the millimeter scale). Such microscopes distinguish themselves for having very low phototoxicity levels and high spatial and temporal resolution, properties that make them ideal for a large range of applications. These include the study of cellular dynamics, in particular cellular motion which is essential to processes such as tumor metastasis and tissue development. Experimental setups make extensive use of microdevices (bioMEMS) that provide better control over the substrate environment than traditional cell culture experiments. For example, to mimic in vivo conditions, experiment biochemical dynamics, and trap, move or count cells. Microdevices provide a higher degree of empirical complexity but, so far, most have been designed to be imaged through wide-field or confocal microscopes. Nonetheless, the properties of LSFM render it ideal for 3D characterization of active cells. When working with microdevices, confocal microscopy is more widespread than LSFM even though it suffers from higher phototoxicity and slower acquisition speeds. It is sometimes possible to illuminate with a light-sheet microdevices designed for confocal microscopes. However, these bioMEMS must be redesigned to exploit the full potential of LSFM and image more frequently on a wider scale phenomena such as motion, traction, differentiation, and diffusion of molecules. The use of microdevices for LSFM has extended beyond cell tracking studies into experiments regarding cytometry, spheroid cultures and lab-on-a-chip automation. Due to light-sheet microscopy being in its early stages, a setup of these characteristics demands some degree of optical expertise; and designing three-dimensional microdevices requires facilities, ingenuity, and experience in microfabrication. In this paper, we explore different approaches where light-sheet microscopy can achieve single-cell and subcellular resolution within microdevices, and provide a few pointers on how these experiments may be improved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Albert-Smet","given":"Ignacio"},{"family":"Marcos-Vidal","given":"Asier"},{"family":"Vaquero","given":"Juan José"},{"family":"Desco","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Muñoz-Barrutia","given":"Arrate"},{"family":"Ripoll","given":"Jorge"}],"citation-key":"albert-smet2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Neuroanatomy","ISSN":"1662-5129","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Applications of Light-Sheet Microscopy in Microdevices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00001","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"algar2010","abstract":"This review highlights recent trends in the development of multiplexed bioanalyses using quantum dot bioconjugates and donor-acceptor interactions. In these methods, multiple optical signals are generated in response to biorecognition through modulation of the photoluminescence of populations of quantum dots with different emission colors. The donor-acceptor interactions that have been used include fluorescence resonance energy transfer, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, charge transfer quenching, and quenching via proximal gold nanoparticles. Assays for the simultaneous detection of between two and eight target analytes have been developed, where spectral deconvolution is an important tool. Target analytes have included small molecules, nucleic acid sequences, and proteases. The unique optical properties of quantum dots offer several potential advantages in multiplexed detection, and a large degree of versatility, for example, one pot multiplexing at the ensemble level, where only wavelength discrimination is required to differentiate between detection channels. These methods are not being developed to compete with array-based technologies in terms of overall multiplexing capacity, but rather to enable new formats for multiplexed bioanalyses. In particular, quantum dot bioprobes based on donor-acceptor interactions are anticipated to provide future opportunities for multiplexed biosensing within living cells.","author":[{"family":"Algar","given":"W.

  {"id":"alshebli2020","abstract":"We study mentorship in scientific collaborations, where a junior scientist is supported by potentially multiple senior collaborators, without them necessarily having formal supervisory roles. We identify 3 million mentor–protégé pairs and survey a random sample, verifying that their relationship involved some form of mentorship. We find that mentorship quality predicts the scientific impact of the papers written by protégés post mentorship without their mentors. We also find that increasing the proportion of female mentors is associated not only with a reduction in post-mentorship impact of female protégés, but also a reduction in the gain of female mentors. While current diversity policies encourage same-gender mentorships to retain women in academia, our findings raise the possibility that opposite-gender mentorship may actually increase the impact of women who pursue a scientific career. These findings add a new perspective to the policy debate on how to best elevate the status of women in science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"AlShebli","given":"Bedoor"},{"family":"Makovi","given":"Kinga"},{"family":"Rahwan","given":"Talal"}],"citation-key":"alshebli2020","container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-19723-8","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,17]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"5855","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The association between early career informal mentorship in academic collaborations and junior author performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19723-8","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"altintas2015","abstract":"Molecular biosensors: promising new tools for early detection of cancer Zeynep Altintas, Ibtisam E Tothill Biomedical Engineering, Cranfield University, Cranfield, UK  Abstract: Over the last decade, an increasing number of researchers have focused on developing rapid techniques based on biosensor technology for the detection of various human health-related conditions. Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and infectious diseases are at the top of these investigations. Huge advances have taken place in a wide range of disciplines, with improved sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the designed methodologies. Advances in other scientific disciplines, including genetics, chemical and microelectronic engineering, computational sciences, and medicine have also impacted on the developments taking place in the diagnostics field. As a result of these developments, more stable, rapid, and reliable sensing platforms have been successfully constructed for specific and ultrasensitive biomarker-based disease diagnostics. These achievements were also a result of improving sensor production quality, developing appropriate surface chemistries, selection of high affinity ligands for target biomarkers, and using nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, magnetic/gold nanoparticles, or quantum dots for signal amplification. Moreover, use of bioinformatics tools, combined with proteomics and genomics technologies and metabolomics, has significantly improved the knowledge and discovery of new biomarkers that can be used for early detection. Due to these significant outputs, coupled with advances in miniaturization and nanotechnology, the demand for development and production of sensor systems, including optical, piezoelectric/acoustic, electrochemical, and colorimetric, has gradually increased during the last decade. Moreover, not only protein and gene markers, but also secondary metabolites and cell signaling pathway molecules can be used for disease detection. To date, diagnostic tests for the early detection of cancer biomarkers are available on the market, and these provide noninvasive/minimally invasive tests that can play a crucial role both in successful treatment and patient survival. This paper reviews disease biomarkers, post-genomic technology, and use of molecular biosensors for early detection of cancer.Keywords: cancer, biomarker discovery, post-genomic technology, molecular biosensors, disease diagnostics","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Altintas","given":"Zeynep"},{"family":"Tothill","given":"Ibtisam E."}],"citation-key":"altintas2015","container-title":"Nanobiosensors in Disease Diagnosis","container-title-short":"NDD","DOI":"10.2147/NDD.S56772","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,19]]},"language":"English","page":"1-10","publisher":"Dove Press","source":"www.dovepress.com","title":"Molecular biosensors: promising new tools for early detection of cancer","title-short":"Molecular biosensors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.dovepress.com/molecular-biosensors-promising-new-tools-for-early-detection-of-cancer-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-NDD","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"alvarez-barrientos2000","abstract":"Classical microbiology techniques are relatively slow in comparison to other analytical techniques, in many cases due to the need to culture the microorganisms. Furthermore, classical approaches are difficult with unculturable microorganisms. More recently, the emergence of molecular biology techniques, particularly those on antibodies and nucleic acid probes combined with amplification techniques, has provided speediness and specificity to microbiological diagnosis. Flow cytometry (FCM) allows single- or multiple-microbe detection in clinical samples in an easy, reliable, and fast way. Microbes can be identified on the basis of their peculiar cytometric parameters or by means of certain fluorochromes that can be used either independently or bound to specific antibodies or oligonucleotides. FCM has permitted the development of quantitative procedures to assess antimicrobial susceptibility and drug cytotoxicity in a rapid, accurate, and highly reproducible way. Furthermore, this technique allows the monitoring of in vitro antimicrobial activity and of antimicrobial treatments ex vivo. The most outstanding contribution of FCM is the possibility of detecting the presence of heterogeneous populations with different responses to antimicrobial treatments. Despite these advantages, the application of FCM in clinical microbiology is not yet widespread, probably due to the lack of access to flow cytometers or the lack of knowledge about the potential of this technique. One of the goals of this review is to attempt to mitigate this latter circumstance. We are convinced that in the near future, the availability of commercial kits should increase the use of this technique in the clinical microbiology laboratory.","author":[{"family":"Alvarez-Barrientos","given":"A."},{"family":"Arroyo","given":"J."},{"family":"Cantón","given":"R."},{"family":"Nombela","given":"C."},{"family":"Sánchez-Pérez","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"alvarez-barrientos2000","container-title":"Clinical Microbiology Reviews","container-title-short":"Clin Microbiol Rev","DOI":"10.1128/CMR.13.2.167","ISSN":"0893-8512","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"167-195","PMCID":"PMC100149","PMID":"10755996","source":"PubMed","title":"Applications of flow cytometry to clinical microbiology","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"alvarez2023","abstract":"Apis mellifera royal jelly (RJ) is a well-known remedy in traditional medicine around the world and its versatile effects range from antibacterial to anti-inflammatory properties and pro-regenerative properties. As a glandular product, RJ has been shown to contain a substantial number of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and, in this study, we aimed to investigate the extent of involvement of RJEVs in wound healing-associated effects. Molecular analysis of RJEVs verified the presence of exosomal markers such as CD63 and syntenin, and cargo molecules MRJP1, defensin-1, and jellein-3. Furthermore, RJEVs were demonstrated to modulate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation and secretome, as well as decrease LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In vivo studies confirmed antibacterial effects of RJEVs and demonstrated an acceleration of wound healing in a splinted mouse model. This study suggests that RJEVs play a crucial role in the known effects of RJ by modulating the inflammatory phase and cellular response in wound healing. Transfer of RJ into the clinics has been impeded by the high complexity of the raw material. Isolating EVs from the raw RJ decreases the complexity while allowing standardization and quality control, bringing a natural nano-therapy one step closer to the clinics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Álvarez","given":"Simón"},{"family":"Contreras-Kallens","given":"Pamina"},{"family":"Aguayo","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Ramírez","given":"Orlando"},{"family":"Vallejos","given":"Catalina"},{"family":"Ruiz","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Carrasco-Gallardo","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Troncoso-Vera","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Morales","given":"Bernardo"},{"family":"Schuh","given":"Christina M.

Anemia leads to impaired cognitive development in children, as well as high morbidity and early mortality among sufferers. Anemia can be caused by nutritional deficiencies, oncologic treatments and diseases, infections such as malaria, as well as inherited hemoglobin or red cell disorders. Effective treatments are available for anemia upon early detection and the treatment method is highly dependent on the cause of anemia. There is a need for point-of-care (POC) screening, early diagnosis, and monitoring, which are currently not widely accessible due to technical challenges and cost, especially in low- and middle-income countries where anemia is most prevalent. This review first introduces the evolution of developed anemia detection methods followed by their implementation in current commercially available POC anemia detection devices. Emerging POC anemia detection technologies leveraging novel methods are reviewed. Finally, we highlight the future trends of integrating anemia detection with the diagnosis of relevant underlying disorders to accurately identify specific root causes and to facilitate personalized treatment and care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"An","given":"Ran"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yuning"},{"family":"Man","given":"Yuncheng"},{"family":"Valentine","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Kucukal","given":"Erdem"},{"family":"Goreke","given":"Utku"},{"family":"Sekyonda","given":"Zoe"},{"family":"Piccone","given":"Connie"},{"family":"Owusu-Ansah","given":"Amma"},{"family":"Ahuja","given":"Sanjay"},{"family":"Little","given":"Jane A."},{"family":"Gurkan","given":"Umut A."}],"citation-key":"an2021","container-title":"Lab on a Chip","container-title-short":"Lab Chip","DOI":"10.1039/D0LC01235A","ISSN":"1473-0189","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,31]]},"language":"en","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","source":"pubs.rsc.org","title":"Emerging Point-of-Care Technologies for Anemia Detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/lc/d0lc01235a"},

  {"id":"anniewillysson2021","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles are released during infectious, inflammatory and prothrombotic conditions. These are membrane-derived vesicles shed by cells during activation, senescence and/or apoptosis. Extracellular vesicles contain and transfer components of the parent cell from which they are shed. During gastrointestinal infection with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) extracellular vesicles are released from blood cells into the circulation and contain Shiga toxin, the main EHEC virulence factor with potent cytotoxic effects. EHEC can cause hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic uremic syndrome, characterized by acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, and non-immune hemolytic anemia. This PhD thesis addressed mechanisms of release and uptake of Shiga toxin-positive extracellular vesicles and characterized prothrombotic and proinflammatory properties related to vesicles released after Shiga toxin stimulation of blood cells. The thesis also provides methodology for the of these extracellular vesicles.Paper I shows that once Shiga toxin is taken up by cells it is released within vesicles within minutes and does not undergo retrograde transport. Toxin could bind directly to extracellular vesicles and could transfer from the surface to the inside of the vesicle suggesting sequestration, possibly to evade the host response. This is a novel mechanism by which vesicles could protect their content while in the circulation.Paper II investigated the importance of the toxin receptor, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), in recipient cells for the uptake of Shiga toxin-containing extracellular vesicles by the cells and exertion of a cytotoxic effect. Various Gb3-negative and Gb3-positive cells were used showing that the recipient cell must possess endogenous Gb3 for the toxin, taken up in extracellular vesicles, to exert a toxic effect on cell viability.Paper III investigated the pro-thrombotic and proinflammatory properties of Shiga toxin-induced blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles. These vesicles possessed more tissue factor activity and thrombin- generating activity and induced platelet aggregation. The vesicles contained pro-inflammatory cytokines and induced the release of IL-8 from endothelial cells co-incubated with monocytes.Paper IV describes isolation procedures of blood cell- and cell culture-derived microvesicles and characterization of the vesicles by various methods including flow cytometry, electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking, ELISA, proteomics and live cell imaging.In summary, this thesis characterized important aspects of Shiga toxin-induced extracellular vesicles including their uptake, intracellular effects, release, and properties that can contribute to the development of hemolytic uremic syndrome.","author":[{"literal":"Annie Willysson"}],"citation-key":"anniewillysson2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3217546131","title":"Extracellular vesicles in Shiga toxin-mediated disease","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"apte2011","abstract":"Despite significant technological and conceptual advances over the last century, evaluation of the efficacy of anti-malarial vaccines or drugs continues to rely principally on direct microscopic visualisation of parasites on thick and/or thin Giemsa-stained blood smears. This requires technical expertise of the microscopist, is highly subjective and error-prone, and does not account for aberrations such as anaemia. Many published methods have shown that flow cytometric analysis of blood is a highly versatile method that can readily detect nucleic acid-stained parasitised red blood cells within cultured cell populations and in ex-vivo samples. However several impediments, including the difficulty in distinguishing reticulocytes from infected red blood cells and the fickle nature of red blood cells, have precluded the development and universal adoption of flow-cytometric based assays for ex-vivo sample analysis. We have developed a novel high-throughput assay for the flow cytometric assessment of blood that overcomes these impediments by utilising the unique properties of the nucleic acid stain DAPI to differentially stain RNA and DNA, combined with novel fixation and analysis protocols. The assay allows the rapid and reliable analysis of multiple parameters from micro-volumes of blood, including: parasitaemia, platelet count, reticulocyte count, normocyte count, white blood cell count and delineation of subsets and phenotypic markers including, but not limited to, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and the expression of phenotypic markers such as PD-L1 or intracellular cytokines. The assay requires less than one drop of blood and is therefore suitable for short interval time-course experiments and allows the progression of infection and immune responses to be closely monitored in the laboratory or cytometer-equipped field locations. Herein, we describe the technique and demonstrate its application in vaccinology and with a range of rodent and human parasite species including Plasmodium yoelii, Plasmodium chabaudi, Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum.","author":[{"family":"Apte","given":"Simon H."},{"family":"Groves","given":"Penny L."},{"family":"Roddick","given":"Joanne S."},{"family":"P da Hora","given":"Vanusa"},{"family":"Doolan","given":"Denise L."}],"citation-key":"apte2011","container-title":"International Journal for Parasitology","container-title-short":"Int J Parasitol","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijpara.2011.07.010","ISSN":"1879-0135","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",10]]},"language":"eng","page":"1285-1294","PMID":"21907206","source":"PubMed","title":"High-throughput multi-parameter flow-cytometric analysis from micro-quantities of plasmodium-infected blood","type":"article-journal","volume":"41"},
  {"id":"arab2021","abstract":"We compared four orthogonal technologies for sizing, counting, and phenotyping of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and synthetic particles. The platforms were: single-particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensing (SP-IRIS) with fluorescence, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with fluorescence, microfluidic resistive pulse sensing (MRPS), and nanoflow cytometry measurement (NFCM). EVs from the human T lymphocyte line H9 (high CD81, low CD63) and the promonocytic line U937 (low CD81, high CD63) were separated from culture conditioned medium (CCM) by differential ultracentrifugation (dUC) or a combination of ultrafiltration (UF) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Western blot (WB). Mixtures of synthetic particles (silica and polystyrene spheres) with known sizes and/or concentrations were also tested. MRPS and NFCM returned similar particle counts, while NTA detected counts approximately one order of magnitude lower for EVs, but not for synthetic particles. SP-IRIS events could not be used to estimate particle concentrations. For sizing, SP-IRIS, MRPS, and NFCM returned similar size profiles, with smaller sizes predominating (per power law distribution), but with sensitivity typically dropping off below diameters of 60 nm. NTA detected a population of particles with a mode diameter greater than 100 nm. Additionally, SP-IRIS, MRPS, and NFCM were able to identify at least three of four distinct size populations in a mixture of silica or polystyrene nanoparticles. Finally, for tetraspanin phenotyping, the SP-IRIS platform in fluorescence mode was able to detect at least two markers on the same particle, while NFCM detected either CD81 or CD63.

Although significant success has been achieved in malaria therapeutic development, accurate early-stage diagnosis of the disease remains a barrier to eradication, especially in low-resource areas. Optical microscopy and antibody-based diagnostic tests are commonly used for identifying the infected population. However, the cost and reliability of these methods in low-resource environments limit the efficacy and accuracy of malaria screening. In this work, we designed, built, and validated a portable optical diagnostic system for malaria detection. The system is based on the detection of Hemozoin, which is a magnetic nanoparticle byproduct of the parasite. Therefore, the presence of Hemozoin is indicative of malarial infection. Unlike all other naturally occurring materials in the blood, hemozoin is paramagnetic. This property is the foundation of our magneto-optic detection system. In our experiments, &beta;-hematin (a mimic for hemozoin) is used to allow for the verification of our device without the need to handle malaria-infected samples. The system is optimized and tested with spherical iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles and &beta;-hematin in different concentrations of PEG solutions. Finally, &beta;-hematin in whole rabbit blood is detected with this system. Detection limits of &lt;8.1 ng/mL (corresponding to &lt;26 parasites/&mu;L) in 500&mu;L of blood are demonstrated. The threshold for early stage malaria infection is 100 parasites/&mu;L.

Current global warming of ~1.1°C above preindustrial temperatures already lies within the lower end of some tipping point uncertainty ranges. Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to <2°C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3°C of warming expected on current policy trajectories.

Nine policy-relevant tipping elements and their CTPs were originally identified by Lenton\n                et al\n                . (2008). We carry out the first comprehensive reassessment of all suggested tipping elements, their CTPs, and the timescales and impacts of tipping. We also highlight steps to further improve understanding of CTPs, including an expert elicitation, a model intercomparison project, and early warning systems leveraging deep learning and remotely sensed data.\n              \n            \n            \n              RATIONALE\n              \n                Since the original identification of tipping elements there have been substantial advances in scientific understanding from paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies. Additional tipping elements have been proposed (e.g., parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet) and the status of others (e.g., Arctic summer sea ice) has been questioned. Observations have revealed that parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet may have already passed a tipping point. Potential early warning signals of the Greenland ice sheet, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, and Amazon rainforest destabilization have been detected. Multiple abrupt shifts have been found in climate models. Recent work has suggested that up to 15 tipping elements are now active (Lenton\n                et al\n                ., 2019). Hence it is timely to synthesize this new knowledge to provide a revised shortlist of potential tipping elements and their CTP thresholds.\n              \n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              We identify nine global “core” tipping elements which contribute substantially to Earth system functioning and seven regional “impact” tipping elements which contribute substantially to human welfare or have great value as unique features of the Earth system (see figure). Their estimated CTP thresholds have significant implications for climate policy: Current global warming of ~1.1°C above pre-industrial already lies within the lower end of five CTP uncertainty ranges. Six CTPs become likely (with a further four possible) within the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to <2°C warming, including collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, die-off of low-latitude coral reefs, and widespread abrupt permafrost thaw. An additional CTP becomes likely and another three possible at the ~2.6°C of warming expected under current policies.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSION\n              Our assessment provides strong scientific evidence for urgent action to mitigate climate change. We show that even the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2°C and preferably 1.5°C is not safe as 1.5°C and above risks crossing multiple tipping points. Crossing these CTPs can generate positive feedbacks that increase the likelihood of crossing other CTPs. Currently the world is heading toward ~2 to 3°C of global warming; at best, if all net-zero pledges and nationally determined contributions are implemented it could reach just below 2°C. This would lower tipping point risks somewhat but would still be dangerous as it could trigger multiple climate tipping points.\n              \n                \n                  The location of climate tipping elements in the cryosphere (blue), biosphere (green), and ocean/atmosphere (orange), and global warming levels at which their tipping points will likely be triggered.\n                  Pins are colored according to our central global warming threshold estimate being below 2°C, i.e., within the Paris Agreement range (light orange, circles); between 2 and 4°C, i.e., accessible with current policies (orange, diamonds); and 4°C and above (red, triangles).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Armstrong McKay","given":"David I."},{"family":"Staal","given":"Arie"},{"family":"Abrams","given":"Jesse F."},{"family":"Winkelmann","given":"Ricarda"},{"family":"Sakschewski","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Loriani","given":"Sina"},{"family":"Fetzer","given":"Ingo"},{"family":"Cornell","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Rockström","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Lenton","given":"Timothy M."}],"citation-key":"armstrongmckay2022","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.abn7950","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6611","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,9]]},"language":"en","page":"eabn7950","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Exceeding 1.5°C global warming could trigger multiple climate tipping points","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950","volume":"377"},
  {"id":"arter2020","abstract":"Exploration and characterisation of the human proteome is a key objective enabling a heightened understanding of biological function, malfunction and pharmaceutical design. Since proteins typically exhibit their behaviour by binding to other proteins, the challenge of probing protein-protein interactions has been the focus of new and improved experimental approaches. Here, we review recently developed microfluidic techniques for the study and quantification of protein–protein interactions. We focus on methodologies that utilise the inherent strength of microfluidics for the control of mass transport on the micron scale, to facilitate surface and membrane-free interrogation and quantification of interacting proteins. Thus, the microfluidic tools described here provide the capability to yield insights on protein–protein interactions under physiological conditions. We first discuss the defining principles of microfluidics, and methods for the analysis of protein–protein interactions that utilise the diffusion-controlled mixing characteristic of fluids at the microscale. We then describe techniques that employ electrophoretic forces to manipulate and fractionate interacting protein systems for their biophysical characterisation, before discussing strategies that use microdroplet compartmentalisation for the analysis of protein interactions. We conclude by highlighting future directions for the field, such as the integration of microfluidic experiments into high-throughput workflows for the investigation of protein interaction networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Arter","given":"William E."},{"family":"Levin","given":"Aviad"},{"family":"Krainer","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Knowles","given":"Tuomas P.

  {"id":"bachas","abstract":"Background Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) at risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are difficult to identify. The bone marrows of MDS patients harbor specific hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) abnormalities that may be associated with sub-types and risk-groups. Leukemia-associated characteristics of such cells may identify MDS patients at risk of progression to AML and provide insight in the pathobiology of MDS. Methods Bone marrow samples from healthy donors (n = 10), low risk (n = 12) and high risk (n = 13) MDS patients were collected, in addition, AML samples for 5 out of 6 MDS patients that progressed. Mass cytometry was applied to assess expression of stem cell subset and leukemia-associated immunophenotype markers. Results We analyzed the data using FlowSOM to cluster cells with similar expression of 10 commonly used stem cell markers. Metaclusters (n = 20) of these clusters represented populations of cells with a related phenotype, largely resembling known stem cell subsets. Within specific subsets, intra-cellular expression levels of pCREB, IkBα, or pS6 differed significantly between healthy bone marrow (HBM) and MDS or consecutive secondary AML samples. CD34, CD44, and CD49f expression was significantly increased in high risk MDS and AML-associated metaclusters. We identified MDS/sAML cells with aberrant phenotypes when compared to HBM. Such cells were observed in clusters of both primary MDS and secondary AML samples. Conclusions High-dimensional mass cytometry and computational data analyses enabled characterization of HSPC subsets in MDS and identification of leukemia stem cell populations based on their immunophenotype. Stem cells in MDS that display leukemia-associated features may predict the risk of developing AML.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Bachas","given":"Costa"},{"family":"Duetz","given":"Carolien"},{"family":"Spronsen","given":"Margot F.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Verhoeff","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Garcia Vallejo","given":"Juan J."},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Joop H."},{"family":"Cloos","given":"Jacqueline"},{"family":"Westers","given":"Theresia M."},{"family":"Loosdrecht","given":"Arjan A.","non-dropping-particle":"van de"}],"citation-key":"bachas","container-title":"Cytometry Part B: Clinical Cytometry","DOI":"10.1002/cyto.b.22066","ISSN":"1552-4957","issue":"n/a","language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Characterization of myelodysplastic syndromes hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells using mass cytometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cyto.b.22066","volume":"n/a"},

  {"id":"baptista2022","abstract":"Despite being preventable and treatable, malaria still puts almost half of the world’s population at risk. Thus, prompt, accurate and sensitive malaria diagnosis is crucial for disease control and elimination. Optical microscopy and immuno-rapid tests are the standard malaria diagnostic methods in the field. However, these are time-consuming and fail to detect low-level parasitemia. Biosensors and lab-on-a-chip devices, as reported to different applications, usually offer high sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use at the point of care. Thus, these can be explored as an alternative for malaria diagnosis. Alongside malaria infection inside the human red blood cells, parasites consume host hemoglobin generating the hemozoin crystal as a by-product. Hemozoin is produced in all parasite species either in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.

Hemozoin is, therefore, a unique indicator of infection, being used as a malaria biomarker.

  {"id":"barbabazan2021","abstract":"Live-cell microscopy imaging typically involves the use of high-quality glass-bottom chambers that allow cell culture, gaseous buffer exchange and optical properties suitable for microscopy applications. However, commercial sources of these chambers can add significant annual costs to cell biology laboratories. Consumer products in three-dimensional printing technology, for both Filament Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Masked Stereo Lithography (MSLA), have resulted in more biomedical research labs adopting the use of these devices for prototyping and manufacturing of lab plastic-based items, but rarely consumables. Here we describe a modular, live-cell chamber with multiple design options that can be mixed per experiment. Single reusable carriers and the use of biodegradable plastics, in a hybrid of FDM and MSLA manufacturing methods, reduce plastic waste. The system is easy to adapt to bespoke designs, with concept-to-prototype in a single day, offers significant cost savings to the users over commercial sources, and no loss in dimensional quality or reliability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Barba Bazan","given":"C."},{"family":"Goss","given":"S."},{"family":"Peng","given":"C."},{"family":"Begeja","given":"N."},{"family":"Suart","given":"Ce."},{"family":"Neuman","given":"K."},{"family":"Truant","given":"Ray"}],"citation-key":"barbabazan2021","DOI":"10.1101/2021.10.18.462400","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,19]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Cell Biology","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mod3D: A Low-Cost, Flexible Modular System of Live-Cell Microscopy Chambers and Holders","title-short":"Mod3D","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.10.18.462400"},
  {"id":"barella2020","abstract":"Several fields of applications require a reliable characterization of the photothermal response and heat dissipation of nanoscopic systems, which remains a challenging task for both modeling and experimental measurements. Here, we present an implementation of anti-Stokes thermometry that enables the in situ photothermal characterization of individual nanoparticles (NPs) from a single hyperspectral photoluminescence confocal image. The method is label-free, potentially applicable to any NP with detectable anti-Stokes emission, and does not require any prior information about the NP itself or the surrounding media. With it, we first studied the photothermal response of spherical gold NPs of different sizes on glass substrates, immersed in water, and found that heat dissipation is mainly dominated by the water for NPs larger than 50 nm. Then, the role of the substrate was studied by comparing the photothermal response of 80 nm gold NPs on glass with sapphire and graphene, two materials with high thermal conductivity. For a given irradiance level, the NPs reach temperatures 18% lower on sapphire and 24% higher on graphene than on bare glass. The fact that the presence of a highly conductive material such as graphene leads to a poorer thermal dissipation demonstrates that interfacial thermal resistances play a very significant role in nanoscopic systems and emphasize the need for in situ experimental thermometry techniques. The developed method will allow addressing several open questions about the role of temperature in plasmon-assisted applications, especially ones where NPs of arbitrary shapes are present in complex matrixes and environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Barella","given":"Mariano"},{"family":"Violi","given":"Ianina L."},{"family":"Gargiulo","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Luciana P."},{"family":"Goschin","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Guglielmotti","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Pallarola","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Schlücker","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Pilo-Pais","given":"Mauricio"},{"family":"Acuna","given":"Guillermo P."},{"family":"Maier","given":"Stefan A."},{"family":"Cortés","given":"Emiliano"},{"family":"Stefani","given":"Fernando D."}],"citation-key":"barella2020","container-title":"ACS Nano","container-title-short":"ACS Nano","DOI":"10.1021/acsnano.0c06185","ISSN":"1936-0851","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,17]]},"publisher":"American Chemical Society","source":"ACS Publications","title":"In Situ Photothermal Response of Single Gold Nanoparticles through Hyperspectral Imaging Anti-Stokes Thermometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c06185"},

Certainly, there are some important differences, but more and more we are learning that we differ by degree rather than kind. We see these similarities most clearly when we look at human populations that live a more traditional, foraging lifestyle. Barsbai et al. compared more than 300 such foraging human populations with mammal and bird species living in the same environment across a wide array of environmental conditions (see the Perspective by Hill and Boyd). They found that all three groups converged with regard to foraging, social, and reproductive behaviors. Thus, adaptation to environmental selection shapes similar responses across a wide diversity of life forms.\nScience, this issue p. 292; see also p. 235\nBehavior is a way for organisms to respond flexibly to the environmental conditions they encounter.

Here, we show that foraging human populations and nonhuman mammal and bird species that live in a given environment exhibit high levels of similarity in their foraging, reproductive, and social behaviors.

  {"id":"basu2020","abstract":"The movement of intracellular cargo, such as transcripts, proteins, and organelles, is fundamental to cellular function. Neurons, due to their long axons and dendrites, are particularly dependent on proper intracellular trafficking and vulnerable to defects in the movement of intracellular cargo that are noted in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. Accurate quantification of intracellular transport is therefore needed for studying the mechanisms of cargo trafficking, the influence of mutations, and the effects of potentially therapeutic pharmaceuticals. In this article, we introduce an algorithm called “Kymolyzer.” The algorithm can quantify intracellular trafficking along a defined path, such as that formed by the aligned microtubules of axons and dendrites. Kymolyzer works as a semi-autonomous kymography software application. It constructs and analyzes kymographs to measure the movement and distribution of fluorescently tagged objects along a user-defined path. The algorithm can be used under a wide variety of experimental conditions and can extract a diverse array of motility parameters describing intracellular movement, including time spent in motion, percentage of objects in motion, percentage of objects that are stationary, and velocities of motile objects.

  {"id":"bazant2004","abstract":"The response of a model micro-electrochemical system to a time-dependent applied voltage is analyzed. The article begins with a fresh historical review including electrochemistry, colloidal science, and microfluidics. The model problem consists of a symmetric binary electrolyte between parallel-plate, blocking electrodes which suddenly apply a voltage. Compact Stern layers on the electrodes are also taken into account. The Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations are first linearized and solved by Laplace transforms for small voltages, and numerical solutions are obtained for large voltages. The ``weakly nonlinear'' limit of thin double layers is then analyzed by matched asymptotic expansions in the small parameter $\\epsilon = \\lambda_D/L$, where $\\lambda_D$ is the screening length and $L$ the electrode separation. At leading order, the system initially behaves like an RC circuit with a response time of $\\lambda_D L / D$ (not $\\lambda_D^2/D$), where $D$ is the ionic diffusivity, but nonlinearity violates this common picture and introduce multiple time scales. The charging process slows down, and neutral-salt adsorption by the diffuse part of the double layer couples to bulk diffusion at the time scale, $L^2/D$. In the ``strongly nonlinear'' regime (controlled by a dimensionless parameter resembling the Dukhin number), this effect produces bulk concentration gradients, and, at very large voltages, transient space charge. The article concludes with an overview of more general situations involving surface conduction, multi-component electrolytes, and Faradaic processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bazant","given":"Martin Z."},{"family":"Thornton","given":"Katsuyo"},{"family":"Ajdari","given":"Armand"}],"citation-key":"bazant2004","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

In response, various defensive mechanisms have emerged, which are intended to shield companies from the risk of patent infringement. This chapter discusses several of these mechanisms, including defensive publication, patent pledges and open patent agreements. Their legal basis and strategic considerations are examined from the perspective of potential users who are unlikely to build a defensive patent portfolio of their own: start-up entrepreneurs and open innovation communities.

However, static localization noise and the blurring of a particle’s position over camera integration times introduce artifacts into measurement results even for a particle executing simple diffusion. Common data analysis methods based on the mean-square displacement do not properly account for these effects. In this paper, we analyze the statistics of tracking data for freely diffusing particles in realistic experimental scenarios. We derive a convenient and asymptotically optimal maximum likelihood estimator for the diffusion coefficient and for the magnitude of localization noise together with the corresponding Fisher information, which bounds the performance of all unbiased estimators. We find that the effect of varying the illumination profile during the camera integration time is quantified by a motion blur coefficient, R. We also find that a double-pulse illumination sequence maximizes the information content in some common experimental scenarios.

  {"id":"berlingieri","abstract":"In theories of creative destruction, product innovation is a key driver of aggregate economic growth. In this paper, we confront the predictions of these models with the empirical patterns of product innovation, documented based on product-level data on the near-universe of French manufacturing firms. Two key patterns in our data stand in contrast to the workings of the conventional models. First, we find that product innovation is best described as a process of “bursts”–episodes where firms rapidly add a series of products to their portfolio. These bursts lead to substantial shifts in revenue and explain the majority of the variance in firm-level growth. Second, we find that the growth in product-level revenue declines over the course of a product’s life cycle, indicating a diminishing effectiveness of process innovation. Including these features into a quantitative framework that nests the canonical models of creative destruction, we show that innovation bursts explain the concentration of production in a small number of large firms. Our model thus enables the joint study of the determinants of industry concentration and growth in a setting consistent with the empirical patterns of product dynamics. In a quantitative comparison against the conventional models, our theory attributes to creative destruction a substantially greater impact on aggregate productivity growth and on the concentration of production.","author":[{"family":"Berlingieri","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Ridder","given":"Maarten De"},{"family":"Lashkari","given":"Danial"},{"family":"Rigo","given":"Davide"}],"citation-key":"berlingieri","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Growth through Innovation Bursts","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"bettencourt2008","abstract":"Reprint: R0805H We all know that people “hire” products and services to get a job done. Surgeons hire scalpels to dissect soft tissue. Janitors hire soap dispensers and paper towels to remove grime from their hands. To find ways to innovate, it’s critical to deconstruct the job the customer is trying to get done from beginning to end, to gain a complete view of all the points at which a customer might desire more help from a product or service. A methodology called job mapping helps companies analyze the biggest drawbacks of the products and services customers currently use and discover opportunities for innovation. It involves breaking down the task the customer wants to accomplish into the eight universal steps of a job: (1) defining the objectives, (2) locating the necessary inputs, (3) preparing the physical environment, (4) confirming that everything is ready, (5) executing the task, (6) monitoring its progress, (7) making modifications as necessary, and (8) concluding the job. Job mapping differs substantively from process mapping in that the goal is to identify what customers are trying to get done at every step, not what they are doing currently. For example, when an anesthesiologist checks a monitor during a surgical procedure, the action taken is just a means to the end. Detecting a change in patient vital signs is the job the doctor is trying to get done. Within each of the discrete steps lie multiple opportunities for making the job simpler, easier, or faster. By mapping out every step of the job and locating those opportunities, companies can discover new ways to differentiate their offerings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bettencourt","given":"Lance A."},{"family":"Ulwick","given":"Anthony W."}],"citation-key":"bettencourt2008","container-title":"Harvard Business Review","ISSN":"0017-8012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5,1]]},"section":"Innovation","source":"hbr.org","title":"The Customer-Centered Innovation Map","type":"article-magazine","URL":"https://hbr.org/2008/05/the-customer-centered-innovation-map"},

Invention pledges involve the open disclosure of patentable inventions without seeking patent protection, unlike patent pledges for which firms waive patent rights after patenting. Competing theoretical views characterize invention pledges either as low-quality inventions with poor organizational fit or as patentable inventions pledged openly by firms with weak firm-specific patent rights and lead-time advantages. We test these theoretical claims using a novel method that compares the quality of subsequent patents citing IBM invention pledges with similar others. Citing IBM invention pledges is positively correlated with patent quality, inconsistent with theories of adverse selection. IBM patents cite its invention pledges on average two years before others, consistent with private benefits of open disclosure. Cited invention pledges spur follow-on innovation, further highlighting their social benefits. We discuss the generalizability of our results obtained using the sample of cited invention pledges to uncited invention pledges.

A popular explanation for stagnation is that good ideas are harder to find, rendering slowdown inevitable. We present a simple model of the lifecycle of scientific ideas that points to changes in scientist incentives as the cause of scientific stagnation. Over the last five decades, citations have become the dominant way to evaluate scientific contributions and scientists. This emphasis on citations in the measurement of scientific productivity shifted scientist rewards and behavior on the margin toward incremental science and away from exploratory projects that are more likely to fail, but which are the fuel for future breakthroughs. As attention given to new ideas decreased, science stagnated. We also explore ways to broaden how scientific productivity is measured and rewarded, involving both academic search engines such as Google Scholar measuring which contributions explore newer ideas and university administrators and funding agencies utilizing these new metrics in research evaluation. We demonstrate empirically that measures of novelty are correlated with but distinct from measures of scientific impact, which suggests that if also novelty metrics were utilized in scientist evaluation, scientists might pursue more innovative, riskier, projects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhattacharya","given":"Jay"},{"family":"Packalen","given":"Mikko"}],"citation-key":"bhattacharya2020","DOI":"10.3386/w26752","event-place":"Cambridge, MA","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2]]},"language":"en","number":"w26752","page":"w26752","publisher":"National Bureau of Economic Research","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Stagnation and Scientific Incentives","type":"report","URL":"http://www.nber.org/papers/w26752.pdf"},

The occurrence and impact of nanoplastics in ecosystems is almost unknown, in particular due to analytical limitations such as very small sizes that fall below detection limits of current techniques. Here we take advantage of a common interference in analytical flow cytometry to develop a method for the quantification of the number of plastic particles in the 0.6–15 µm size range. Plastic particles are stained with the lipophilic dye Nile-Red then detected by flow cytometry, a method regularly used in biology for rapid quantification of fluorescent cells. We found that sample analysis lasts 90 s, which is hundreds of times faster than the analysis of filter portions by micro-Raman and other spectroscopic techniques. Our method is highly efficient in detecting polyethylene, with staining efficiency higher than 70% and signal linearity with concentration. Staining efficiency up to 96% was observed for polyvinylchloride and for polystyrene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bianco","given":"Angelica"},{"family":"Carena","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Peitsaro","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Sordello","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Vione","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Passananti","given":"Monica"}],"citation-key":"bianco2023","container-title":"Environmental Chemistry Letters","container-title-short":"Environ Chem Lett","DOI":"10.1007/s10311-022-01545-3","ISSN":"1610-3653, 1610-3661","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4]]},"language":"en","page":"647-653","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rapid detection of nanoplastics and small microplastics by Nile-Red staining and flow cytometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10311-022-01545-3","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"biswas","abstract":"Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is essential in optical materials for light-harvesting, photovoltaics, and biosensing, but its operating range is fundamentally limited by the Förster radius of ≈5 nm. In this work, FRET between fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) is studied in order to break this limit. The donor and acceptor NPs are built from charged hydrophobic polymers loaded with cationic dyes and bulky hydrophobic counterions. Their surface is functionalized with DNA in order to control surface-to-surface distance. It is found that the FRET efficiency does not follow the canonic Förster law, reaching 0.70 and 0.45 values for NP–NP distances of 15 and 20 nm, respectively. This corresponds to the FRET efficiency decay as power four of the surface-to-surface NP–NP distance. Based on this long-distance FRET, a DNA nanoprobe is developed, where a target DNA fragment, encoding the cancer marker survivin, bringing together donor and acceptor NPs at ≈15 nm distance. In this nanoprobe, a single-molecular recognition results in unprecedented color switch for >5000 dyes, yielding a simple and fast assay with 18 attomoles limit of detection.

This Primer outlines the importance and challenges of creating hydrogels that mimic the mechanical and biological properties of the native extracellular matrix. The design of hydrogels for mechanobiology studies is discussed, including the appropriate choice of cross-linking chemistry and strategies to tailor hydrogel mechanical cues. Techniques for characterizing hydrogels are explained, highlighting methods used to analyse cell behaviour. Example applications in regenerative medicine and for studying fundamental mechanobiological processes are provided, along with a discussion of the limitations of hydrogels as mimetics of the native extracellular matrix.

However, the ability to detect the total number of virus particles, both infectious and non-infectious, has been an elusive goal that would advance the study of virus assembly and egress. A rapid optical detection scheme for real-time label-free quantitation of HIV-1 virus particles was developed. Virions produced in cell cultures transfected transiently were evaluated with a nanospectroscopic assay. Quantitation with the optical detection scheme correlated with routine conventional assays. Nanospectroscopy can be used for the detection of both infectious and non-infectious, wild type and mutant strains of HIV-1 in solution at concentrations as low as 7×10(10)particles/ml, requiring volumes as small as 2 μl per assay, and in significantly less time than standard techniques.

  {"id":"bordanaba-florit2021","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous lipid containers with a complex molecular cargo comprising several populations with unique roles in biological processes. These vesicles are closely associated with specific physiological features, which makes them invaluable in the detection and monitoring of various diseases. EVs play a key role in pathophysiological processes by actively triggering genetic or metabolic responses. However, the heterogeneity of their structure and composition hinders their application in medical diagnosis and therapies. This diversity makes it difficult to establish their exact physiological roles, and the functions and composition of different EV (sub)populations. Ensemble averaging approaches currently employed for EV characterization, such as western blotting or ‘omics’ technologies, tend to obscure rather than reveal these heterogeneities. Recent developments in single-vesicle analysis have made it possible to overcome these limitations and have facilitated the development of practical clinical applications. In this review, we discuss the benefits and challenges inherent to the current methods for the analysis of single vesicles and review the contribution of these approaches to the understanding of EV biology. We describe the contributions of these recent technological advances to the characterization and phenotyping of EVs, examination of the role of EVs in cell-to-cell communication pathways and the identification and validation of EVs as disease biomarkers. Finally, we discuss the potential of innovative single-vesicle imaging and analysis methodologies using microfluidic devices, which promise to deliver rapid and effective basic and practical applications for minimally invasive prognosis systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Bordanaba-Florit","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Royo","given":"Félix"},{"family":"Kruglik","given":"Sergei G."},{"family":"Falcón-Pérez","given":"Juan M."}],"citation-key":"bordanaba-florit2021","container-title":"Nature Protocols","container-title-short":"Nat Protoc","DOI":"10.1038/s41596-021-00551-z","ISSN":"1750-2799","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Reviews\nSubject_term: Biological techniques;Membrane trafficking;Single-molecule biophysics;Structural biology;Tumour biomarkers\nSubject_term_id: biological-techniques;membrane-trafficking;single-molecule-biophysics;structural-biology;tumour-biomarkers","number":"7","page":"3163-3185","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Using single-vesicle technologies to unravel the heterogeneity of extracellular vesicles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00551-z","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"boughn2013","abstract":"In 1904, the year before Einstein’s seminal papers on special relativity, Austrian physicist Fritz Hasenöhrl examined the properties of blackbody radiation in a moving cavity. He calculated the work necessary to keep the cavity moving at a constant velocity as it fills with radiation and concluded that the radiation energy has associated with it an apparent mass such that $$E = \\tfrac{3}{8}mc^2$$. In a subsequent paper, also in 1904, Hasenöhrl achieved the same result by computing the force necessary to accelerate a cavity already filled with radiation. In early 1905, he corrected the latter result to $$E = \\tfrac{3}{4}mc^2$$. This result, i.e., $$m = \\tfrac{4}{3}E/c^2$$, has led many to conclude that Hasenöhrl fell victim to the same “mistake” made by others who derived this relation between the mass and electrostatic energy of the electron. Some have attributed the mistake to the neglect of stress in the blackbody cavity. In this paper, Hasenöhrl’s papers are examined from a modern, relativistic point of view in an attempt to understand where he went wrong. The primary mistake in his first paper was, ironically, that he didn’t account for the loss of mass of the blackbody end caps as they radiate energy into the cavity. However, even taking this into account one concludes that blackbody radiation has a mass equivalent of $$m = \\tfrac{4}{3}E/c^2$$or $$m = \\tfrac{5}{3}E/c^2$$depending on whether one equates the momentum or kinetic energy of radiation to the momentum or kinetic energy of an equivalent mass. In his second and third papers that deal with an accelerated cavity, Hasenöhrl concluded that the mass associated with blackbody radiation is $$m = \\tfrac{4}{3}E/c^2$$, a result which, within the restricted context of Hasenöhrl’s gedanken experiment, is actually consistent with special relativity. (If one includes all components of the system, including cavity stresses, then the total mass and energy of the system are, to be sure, related by m = E/c2.) Both of these problems are non-trivial and the surprising results, indeed, turn out to be relevant to the “$$\\tfrac{4}{3}$$problem” in classical models of the electron. An important lesson of these analyses is that E = mc2, while extremely useful, is not a “law of physics” in the sense that it ought not be applied indiscriminately to any extended system and, in particular, to the subsystems from which they are comprised. We suspect that similar problems have plagued attempts to model the classical electron.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Boughn","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"boughn2013","container-title":"The European Physical Journal H","container-title-short":"EPJ H","DOI":"10.1140/epjh/e2012-30061-5","ISSN":"2102-6467","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"261-278","source":"Springer Link","title":"Fritz Hasenöhrl and E = mc2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1140/epjh/e2012-30061-5","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"bramanti2009","abstract":"Cultivating Farmers\nWere the ancestors of modern Europeans the local hunter-gatherers who assimilated farming practices from neighboring cultures, or were they farmers who migrated from the Near East in the early Neolithic? By analyzing ancient hunter-gatherer skeletal DNA from 2300 to 13,400 B.C.E. Bramanti et al. (p. 137, published online 3 September) investigated the genetic relationship of European Ice Age hunter-gatherers, the first farmers of Europe, and modern Europeans. The results reject the hypothesis of direct continuity between hunter-gatherers and early farmers and between hunter-gatherers and modern Europeans. Major parts of central and northern Europe were colonized by incoming farmers 7500 years ago, who were not descended from the resident hunter-gatherers. Thus, migration rather than cultural diffusion was the driver of farming communities in Europe.\nAfter the domestication of animals and crops in the Near East some 11,000 years ago, farming had reached much of central Europe by 7500 years before the present. The extent to which these early European farmers were immigrants or descendants of resident hunter-gatherers who had adopted farming has been widely debated. We compared new mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from late European hunter-gatherer skeletons with those from early farmers and from modern Europeans. We find large genetic differences between all three groups that cannot be explained by population continuity alone. Most (82%) of the ancient hunter-gatherers share mtDNA types that are relatively rare in central Europeans today. Together, these analyses provide persuasive evidence that the first farmers were not the descendants of local hunter-gatherers but immigrated into central Europe at the onset of the Neolithic.\nSkeletal DNA shows the relationship between Ice Age hunter-gatherers, the first farmers, and modern Europeans.\nSkeletal DNA shows the relationship between Ice Age hunter-gatherers, the first farmers, and modern Europeans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Bramanti","given":"B."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"M.

It drives the headlines that surround us and the laws that touch our lives. From Machiavelli to Hobbes, Freud to Dawkins, the roots of this belief have sunk deep into Western thought. Human beings, we're taught, are by nature selfish and governed by self-interest. Humankind makes a new argument: that it is realistic, as well as revolutionary, to assume that people are good. The instinct to cooperate rather than compete, trust rather than distrust, has an evolutionary basis going right back to the beginning of Homo sapiens. By thinking the worst of others, we bring out the worst in our politics and economics too. In this major book, internationally bestselling author Rutger Bregman takes some of the world's most famous studies and events and reframes them, providing a new perspective on the last 200,000 years of human history. From the real-life Lord of the Flies to the Blitz, a Siberian fox farm to an infamous New York murder, Stanley Milgram's Yale shock machine to the Stanford prison experiment, Bregman shows how believing in human kindness and altruism can be a new way to think - and act as the foundation for achieving true change in our society.

  {"id":"brittain2019","abstract":"The CytoFLEX is a novel semiconductor-based flow cytometer that utilizes avalanche photodiodes, wavelength-division multiplexing, enhanced optics, and diode lasers to maximize light capture and minimize optical and electronic noise. Due to an increasing interest in the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as disease biomarkers, and the growing desire to use flow cytometry for the analyses of biological nanoparticles, we assessed the light-scatter sensitivity of the CytoFLEX for small-particle detection. We found that the CytoFLEX can fully resolve 70 nm polystyrene and 98.6 nm silica beads by violet side scatter (VSSC). We further analyzed the detection limit for biological nanoparticles, including viruses and EVs, and show that the CytoFLEX can detect viruses down to 81 nm and EVs at least as small as 65 nm. Moreover, we could immunophenotype EV surface antigens, including directly in blood and plasma, demonstrating the double labeling of platelet EVs with CD61 and CD9, as well as triple labeling with CD81 for an EV subpopulation in one donor. In order to assess the refractive indices (RIs) of the viruses and EVs, we devised a new method to inversely calculate the RIs using the intensity vs. size data together with Mie-theory scatter efficiencies scaled to reference-particle measurements. Each of the viruses tested had an equivalent RI, approximately 1.47 at 405 nm, which suggests that flow cytometry can be more broadly used to easily determine virus sizes. We also found that the RIs of EVs increase as the particle diameters decrease below 150 nm, increasing from 1.37 for 200 nm EVs up to 1.61 for 65 nm EVs, expanding the lower range of EVs that can be detected by light scatter. Overall, we demonstrate that the CytoFLEX has an unprecedented level of sensitivity compared to conventional flow cytometers. Accordingly, the CytoFLEX can be of great benefit to virology and EV research, and will help to expand the use of flow cytometry for minimally invasive liquid biopsies by allowing for the direct analysis of antigen expression on biological nanoparticles within patient samples, including blood, plasma, urine and bronchoalveolar lavages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Brittain","given":"George C."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yong Q."},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Edgar"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Vera A."},{"family":"Renner","given":"Tyler M."},{"family":"Langlois","given":"Marc-André"},{"family":"Gulnik","given":"Sergei"}],"citation-key":"brittain2019","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-019-52366-4","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,5]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"16039","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A Novel Semiconductor-Based Flow Cytometer with Enhanced Light-Scatter Sensitivity for the Analysis of Biological Nanoparticles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52366-4","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"burgess2018","abstract":"Self-assembling peptide hydrogels offer a novel 3-dimensional platform for many applications in cell culture and tissue engineering but are not compatible with current methods of RNA isolation; owing to interactions between RNA and the biomaterial. This study investigates the use of two techniques based on two different basic extraction principles: solution-based extraction and direct solid-state binding of RNA respectively, to extract RNA from cells encapsulated in four β-sheet forming self-assembling peptide hydrogels with varying net positive charge. RNA-peptide fibril interactions, rather than RNA-peptide molecular complexing, were found to interfere with the extraction process resulting in low yields. A column-based approach relying on RNA-specific binding was shown to be more suited to extracting RNA with higher purity from these peptide hydrogels owing to its reliance on strong specific RNA binding interactions which compete directly with RNA-peptide fibril interactions. In order to reduce the amount of fibrils present and improve RNA yields a broad spectrum enzyme solution—pronase—was used to partially digest the hydrogels before RNA extraction. This pre-treatment was shown to significantly increase the yield of RNA extracted, allowing downstream RT-qPCR to be performed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Burgess","given":"Kyle A."},{"family":"Workman","given":"Victoria L."},{"family":"Elsawy","given":"Mohamed A."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Aline F."},{"family":"Oceandy","given":"Delvac"},{"family":"Saiani","given":"Alberto"}],"citation-key":"burgess2018","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0197517","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,4]]},"language":"en","page":"e0197517","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"RNA extraction from self-assembling peptide hydrogels to allow qPCR analysis of encapsulated cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197517","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"burke2007","abstract":"Leaders have been argued to play a key role in determining organizational effectiveness across all levels (e.g., individual, team, unit) that exist within organizations. A key component in a leader's ability to be effective within such environments is the degree to which subordinates and co-workers trust him/her. Therefore, it is not surprising that researchers and practitioners alike are interested in identifying the mechanisms through which trust in leadership can be developed as well as those factors which moderate this relationship [e.g., Gillespie, N. A., Mann, L. (2004). Transformational leadership and shared values: The building blocks of trust. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 19, 588–607; Kouzes and Posner, 1995; Roberts, K. H., O'Reilly, C.

The impact of human resource activities on employee trust. Human Resource Management Review, 7, 389–404]. Despite this, research that has addressed the factors that foster trust in leaders and the outcomes of this trust has been disjointed and, as yet, no comprehensive model has been presented to systematically examine these factors. Therefore, the purpose of this article will be to present an integrative model of trust in leadership.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Burke","given":"C.

  {"id":"burnett2017","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Optical detection of circulating haemozoin has been suggested as a needle free method to diagnose malaria using in vivo microscopy. Haemozoin is generated within infected red blood cells by the malaria parasite, serving as a highly specific, endogenous biomarker of malaria. However, phagocytosis of haemozoin by white blood cells which persist after the infection is resolved presents the potential for false positive diagnosis; therefore, the focus of this work is to identify a feature of the haemozoin signal to discriminate between infected red blood cells and haemozoin-containing white blood cells.\nMETHODS: Conventional brightfield microscopy of thin film blood smears was used to analyse haemozoin absorbance signal in vitro. Cell type and parasite maturity were morphologically determined using colocalized DAPI staining. The ability of features to discriminate between infected red blood cells and haemozoin-containing white blood cells was evaluated using images of smears from subjects infected with two species of Plasmodium, Plasmodium yoelii and Plasmodium falciparum. Discriminating features identified by blood smear microscopy were characterized in vivo in P. yoelii-infected mice.\nRESULTS: Two features of the haemozoin signal, haemozoin diameter and normalized intensity difference, were identified as potential parameters to differentiate infected red blood cells and haemozoin-containing white blood cells. Classification performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, with area under the curve values of 0.89 for the diameter parameter and 0.85 for the intensity parameter when assessed in P. yoelii samples. Similar results were obtained from P. falciparum blood smears, showing an AUC of 0.93 or greater for both classification features. For in vivo investigations, the intensity-based metric was the best classifier, with an AUC of 0.91.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that size and intensity features of haemozoin absorbance signal collected by in vivo microscopy are effective classification metrics to discriminate infected red blood cells from haemozoin-containing white blood cells. This reduces the potential for false positive results associated with optical imaging strategies for in vivo diagnosis of malaria based on the endogenous biomarker haemozoin.","author":[{"family":"Burnett","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Carns","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Richards-Kortum","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"burnett2017","container-title":"Malaria Journal","container-title-short":"Malar J","DOI":"10.1186/s12936-017-2096-1","ISSN":"1475-2875","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"447","PMCID":"PMC5678583","PMID":"29115957","source":"PubMed","title":"Towards a needle-free diagnosis of malaria: in vivo identification and classification of red and white blood cells containing haemozoin","title-short":"Towards a needle-free diagnosis of malaria","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"burns2021","abstract":"Public involvement is key to closing the gap between research production and research use, and the only way to achieving ultimate transparency in science. The majority of life science research is not public-facing, but is funded by the public and impacts communities. We undertook an exploratory survey of researchers within the life sciences to better understand their views and perceived challenges to involving the public in their research. As survey response rate could not be determined, interpretation of the results must be cautious. We had a valid response cohort of n = 110 researchers, of whom 90% were primarily laboratory based. Using a mixed methods approach, we demonstrate that a top-down approach is key to motivate progression of life scientists from feeling positive towards public involvement to actually engaging in it. Researchers who viewed public involvement as beneficial to their research were more likely to have direct experience of doing it. We demonstrate that the systemic flaws in the way life sciences research enterprise is organised, including the promotion system, hyper-competition, and time pressures are major barriers to involving the public in the scientific process. Scientists are also apprehensive of being involuntarily involved in the current politicized climate; misinformation and publicity hype surrounding science nowadays makes them hesitant to share their early and in-progress research. The time required to deliberate study design and relevance, plan and build relationships for sustained involvement, provide and undertake training, and improve communication in the current research environment is often considered nonpragmatic, particularly for early career researchers. In conclusion, a top-down approach involving institutional incentives and infrastructure appears most effective at transitioning researchers from feeling positive towards public involvement to actually implementing it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Burns","given":"John A."},{"family":"Holden","given":"Sinead"},{"family":"Korzec","given":"Kora"},{"family":"Dorris","given":"Emma R."}],"citation-key":"burns2021","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0250023","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e0250023","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"From intent to implementation: Factors affecting public involvement in life science research","title-short":"From intent to implementation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250023","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"bush2021","abstract":"Pre-Columbian reforestation in Amazonia\nAn early 17th-century temporary reduction in global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels has now been attributed to reforestation in Amazonia after the catastrophic loss of life of the indigenous population caused by diseases brought by European invaders. Using fossil pollen data from Amazonian lake sediments with temporal resolution over the past millennium, Bush et al. found that forest recovery began 300 to 600 years before the population crash. The more recent nadir in atmospheric CO2 was not associated with rapid reforestation at that time. The vegetation changes appear to be the result of changing patterns of land use in the centuries preceding the European arrival and the resulting devastation, whereas the cause of the CO2 decline remains enigmatic.\nScience, this issue p. 484\nAn estimated 90 to 95% of Indigenous people in Amazonia died after European contact. This population collapse is postulated to have caused decreases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at around 1610 CE, as a result of a wave of land abandonment in the wake of disease, slavery, and warfare, whereby the attendant reversion to forest substantially increased terrestrial carbon sequestration. On the basis of 39 Amazonian fossil pollen records, we show that there was no synchronous reforestation event associated with such an atmospheric carbon dioxide response after European arrival in Amazonia. Instead, we find that, at most sites, land abandonment and forest regrowth began about 300 to 600 years before European arrival. Pre-European pandemics, social strife, or environmental change may have contributed to these early site abandonments and ecological shifts.\nPollen records show that site abandonment and forest regrowth in Amazonia began up to 600 years before European arrival.\nPollen records show that site abandonment and forest regrowth in Amazonia began up to 600 years before European arrival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Bush","given":"M.

  {"id":"cann2021","abstract":"Exposure to media content is an important component of opinion formation around climate change. Online social media such as Twitter, the focus of this study, provide an avenue to study public engagement and digital media dissemination related to climate change. Sharing a link to an online article is an indicator of media engagement. Aggregated link-sharing forms a network structure which maps collective media engagement by the user population. Here we construct bipartite networks linking Twitter users to the web pages they shared, using a dataset of approximately 5.3 million English-language tweets by almost 2 million users during an eventful seven-week period centred on the announcement of the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Community detection indicates that the observed information-sharing network can be partitioned into two weakly connected components, representing subsets of articles shared by a group of users. We characterise these partitions through analysis of web domains and text content from shared articles, finding them to be broadly described as a left-wing/environmentalist group and a right-wing/climate sceptic group. Correlation analysis shows a striking positive association between left/right political ideology and environmentalist/sceptic climate ideology respectively. Looking at information-sharing over time, there is considerable turnover in the engaged user population and the articles that are shared, but the web domain sources and polarised network structure are relatively persistent. This study provides evidence that online sharing of news media content related to climate change is both polarised and politicised, with implications for opinion dynamics and public debate around this important societal challenge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Cann","given":"Tristan J.

  {"id":"caputo2019","abstract":"The particle size distribution (PSD) and the stability of nanoparticles enabled medicinal products (NEP) in complex biological environments are key attributes to assess their quality, safety and efficacy. Despite its low resolution, dynamic light scattering (DLS) is the most common sizing technique since the onset of NEP in pharmaceutical technologies. Considering the limitations of the existing sizing measurements and the challenges posed by complex NEPs both scientists and regulators encourage the combination of multiple orthogonal high-resolution approaches to shed light in the NEP sizing space (e.g. dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, field flow fractionation coupled to online sizing detectors, centrifugal techniques, particle tracking analysis and tunable resistive pulse sensing). The pharmaceutical and biotechnology developers are now challenged to find their own pragmatic characterisation approaches, which should be fit for purpose and minimize costs at the same time, in a complicated landscape where only a few standards exist. In order to support the community, the European Nanomedicine Characterisation Laboratory (EUNCL) and the US National Cancer Institute Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (NCI-NCL) have jointly developed multiple standard operating procedures (SOPs) for NEP assessment, including the measurements of particle size distribution, and are offering wide access to their ‘state of the art’ characterisation platforms, in addition to making SOPs publicly available. This joint perspective article would like to present the NCI-NCL and EUNCL multi-step approach of incremental complexity to measure particle size distribution and size stability of NEPs, consisting of a quick preliminary step to assess sample integrity and stability by low resolution techniques (pre-screening), followed by the combination of complementary high resolution sizing measurements performed both in simple buffers and in complex biological media. Test cases are presented to demonstrate: i) the need for employing at least one high-resolution sizing technique, ii) the importance of selecting the correct sizing techniques for the purpose, and iii) the robustness of utilizing orthogonal sizing techniques to study the physical properties of complex NEP samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Caputo","given":"F."},{"family":"Clogston","given":"J."},{"family":"Calzolai","given":"L."},{"family":"Rösslein","given":"M."},{"family":"Prina-Mello","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"caputo2019","container-title":"Journal of Controlled Release","container-title-short":"Journal of Controlled Release","DOI":"10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.02.030","ISSN":"0168-3659","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,10]]},"language":"en","page":"31-43","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Measuring particle size distribution of nanoparticle enabled medicinal products, the joint view of EUNCL and NCI-NCL.

  {"id":"carravilla2021","abstract":"<h2>Abstract</h2><p>Understanding the plasma membrane nanoscale organization and dynamics in living cells requires microscopy techniques with high spatial and temporal resolution that permit for long acquisition times and allow for the quantification of membrane biophysical properties, such as lipid ordering. Among the most popular super-resolution techniques, stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy offers one of the highest temporal resolutions, ultimately defined by the scanning speed. However, monitoring live processes using STED microscopy is significantly limited by photobleaching, which recently has been circumvented by exchangeable membrane dyes that only temporarily reside in the membrane. Here, we show that NR4A, a polarity-sensitive exchangeable plasma membrane probe based on Nile red, permits the super-resolved quantification of membrane biophysical parameters in real time with high temporal and spatial resolution as well as long acquisition times. The potential of this polarity-sensitive exchangeable dye is showcased by live-cell real-time three-dimensional STED recordings of bleb formation and lipid exchange during membrane fusion as well as by STED-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments for the simultaneous quantification of membrane dynamics and lipid packing that correlate in model and live-cell membranes.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Carravilla","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Anindita"},{"family":"Zhurgenbayeva","given":"Gaukhar"},{"family":"Danylchuk","given":"Dmytro I."},{"family":"Klymchenko","given":"Andrey S."},{"family":"Sezgin","given":"Erdinc"},{"family":"Eggeling","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"carravilla2021","container-title":"Biophysical Reports","container-title-short":"Biophysical Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.bpr.2021.100023","ISSN":"2667-0747","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,8]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"www.cell.com","title":"Long-term STED imaging of membrane packing and dynamics by exchangeable polarity-sensitive dyes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cell.com/biophysreports/abstract/S2667-0747(21)00023-9","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"castelli2007","abstract":"Corrosion resistant structural materials of both iron and nickel based alloys are used in the electric power industry for the construction of the coolant loops of both conventional and nuclear power generating stations. These materials, in the presence of high temperature (e.g. 287°C), high pH (e.g. 10.0 at 20°C) water with dissolved hydrogen will oxidize and form corrosion films that are double metal oxides (or spinels) of the form AB2O4. This work describes optical reflectivity techniques that have been developed to study the growth of these films in situ. The optical technique uses a dual-beam specular reflection spectrometer to measure the spectrum of reflected light in small angle (i.e. <15°) scatter. The reflection spectra are then calibrated using a set of corrosion coupons with corrosion films that are well known. Results are compared with models based on multilayer reflection and Mie scattering from a particle size distribution. Surface roughness is found to be the dominant cause of reduced reflection as the films grow.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Castelli","given":"R.

  {"id":"chance2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND \n        Extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from cardiosphere-derived cells (CDC-EVs) are coming to light as a unique cell-free therapeutic. Because of their novelty, however, there still exist prominent gaps in knowledge regarding their therapeutic potential. Herein the therapeutic potential of CDC-EVs in a rat model of acute traumatic coagulopathy induced by multiple injuries and hemorrhagic shock is outlined.\n        METHODS \n        Extracellular vesicle surface expression of procoagulant molecules (tissue factor and phosphatidylserine) was evaluated by flow cytometry. Extracellular vesicle thrombogenicity was tested using calibrated thrombogram, and clotting parameters were assessed using a flow-based adhesion model simulating blood flow over a collagen-expressing surface. The therapeutic efficacy of EVs was then determined in a rat model of acute traumatic coagulopathy induced by multiple injuries and hemorrhagic shock.\n        RESULTS \n        Extracellular vesicles isolated from cardiosphere-derived cells are not functionally procoagulant and do not interfere with platelet function. In a rat model of multiple injuries and hemorrhagic shock, early administration of EVs significantly reduced the elevation of lactate and creatinine and did not significantly enhance coagulopathy in rats with acute traumatic coagulopathy.\n        CONCLUSION \n        The results of this study are of great relevance to the development of EV products for use in combat casualty care, as our studies show that CDC-EVs have the potential to be an antishock therapeutic if administered early. These results demonstrate that research using CDC-EVs in trauma care needs to be considered and expanded beyond their reported cardioprotective benefits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Chance","given":"Tiffani C."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xiaowu"},{"family":"Keesee","given":"Jeffrey D."},{"family":"Garcia-Marcano","given":"Josue"},{"family":"Salgado","given":"Christi L."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Moseley","given":"Jennifer J."},{"family":"Peck","given":"Kiel A."},{"family":"R. -Borlado","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Atai","given":"Nadia A."},{"family":"Gould","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Marban","given":"Linda S."},{"family":"Cap","given":"Andrew P."},{"family":"Rathbone","given":"Christopher R."},{"family":"Bynum","given":"James A."}],"citation-key":"chance2021","container-title":"Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery","DOI":"10.1097/TA.0000000000003218","ISSN":"2163-0755","issue":"2S","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"en-US","page":"S81","source":"journals.lww.com","title":"Extracellular vesicles derived from cardiosphere-derived cells as a potential antishock therapeutic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/Abstract/2021/08002/Extracellular_vesicles_derived_from.12.aspx","volume":"91"},

Such applications include identifying disease-associated screenable phenotypes, understanding disease mechanisms and predicting a drug’s activity, toxicity or mechanism of action. Several of these applications have been recently validated and have moved into production mode within academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Some of these have yielded disappointing results in practice but are now of renewed interest due to improved machine-learning strategies that better leverage image-based information.

However, previous development directions for the technologies of academic patents have mostly focused on patents approved by or applied for with major patent offices; few have examined from the perspective of standard-essential patents (SEPs). This study examined key technologies of academic SEPs through network analysis. The findings revealed that most of the key technologies of academic SEPs are involved in wireless communication networks and the transmission of digital information, electric digital data processing, control or regulating systems, and secret communication systems. Among these, secret communication systems are key technologies in academia, and more scientific research resources should be invested in secret communication R&D in the future. In addition, the key technologies of academic SEPs have changed; specifically, image coding technology has undergone major developments.

  {"id":"chen2016","abstract":"Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) can provide a clinically effective method for delivering small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence pathological genes in hepatocytes. The gene silencing potency of these LNP-siRNA systems has been shown to depend on a variety of factors including association with serum factors such as ApoE and the pKa of component ionizable lipids. Here we investigate the influence of LNP size, an important parameter affecting tissue penetration of LNP systems, on the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and hepatic gene silencing potency of LNP-siRNA systems following intravenous administration. For LNP systems stabilized by a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid that can dissociate from the LNP following injection, it is shown that small (diameter≤30nm) systems are considerably less potent than their larger counterparts. This is attributed in part to the ability of other lipid components, particularly the ionizable amino-lipid, to dissociate from the LNP following dissociation of the PEG-lipid. Small LNP stabilized by PEG-lipids with slow dissociation rates exhibited much reduced amino-lipid dissociation rates, however such systems are relatively impotent due to the continued presence of the PEG coating. These results demonstrate the delicate balance between the in vivo potency of LNP-siRNA systems and the residence times of component lipids in the LNP particle itself and suggest new directions to optimize the in vivo gene silencing potency of small LNP-siRNA systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Tam","given":"Yuen Yi C."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Paulo J.

  {"id":"chen2021","abstract":"Despite the demand for fast-charging lithium (Li)-ion batteries, high-energy-density batteries with thick graphite anodes are limited by Li plating when charging at >4C rates. In this work, plan-view operando video microscopy is applied on >3 mA h cm−2 calendared graphite electrodes to study the dynamic evolution of local state-of-charge (SoC) and Li plating during fast charging. This technique allows for visualization of the spatial heterogeneity in SoC across the electrode, nucleation and growth of Li filaments, Li re-intercalation into graphite, “dead Li” formation, and SoC equilibration. The operando microscopy analysis is complemented by ex situ imaging of through-plane gradients in SoC to gain a three-dimensional visualization of spatial heterogeneity. We demonstrate that (1) Li plating preferentially nucleates on the graphite particles that lithiate fastest during fast charging; (2) the onset of Li plating correlates with the local minimum of the graphite electrode potential; (3) galvanic corrosion currents are responsible for Li re-intercalation, dead Li formation, and SoC re-equilibration after fast charging; and (4) electrochemical signatures during OCV rest or discharge are associated with Li re-intercalation into graphite. This work provides insight into the Li–graphite interactions at the composite electrode level and can be used to inform strategies to diagnose and mitigate Li plating during fast charging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yuxin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Kuan-Hung"},{"family":"Sanchez","given":"Adrian J."},{"family":"Kazyak","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Goel","given":"Vishwas"},{"family":"Gorlin","given":"Yelena"},{"family":"Christensen","given":"Jake"},{"family":"Thornton","given":"Katsuyo"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Neil P."}],"citation-key":"chen2021","container-title":"Journal of Materials Chemistry A","container-title-short":"J.

The separation of bi-directional objects in separated images allows us to reliably detect and track ﬂuorescent particles in ﬂuorescence image sequences, despite numerous crossroad points in the kymograph space. The new abilities provided by the proposed technique are highlighted by the analysis of biological images which were previously impossible to analyze reliably.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Chenouard","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Buisson","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Bloch","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Bastin","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Olivo-Marin","given":"Jean-Christophe"}],"citation-key":"chenouard2010","container-title":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","DOI":"10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652479","event-place":"Hong Kong, Hong Kong","event-title":"2010 17th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2010)","ISBN":"978-1-4244-7992-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9]]},"language":"en","page":"3657-3660","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Hong Kong, Hong Kong","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Curvelet analysis of kymograph for tracking bi-directional particles in fluorescence microscopy images","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5652479/"},

However, microscopes could become much more powerful investigation systems if they were endowed with simple unsupervised decision-making algorithms to transform them into fully responsive and automated measurement devices. Here, we report CyberSco.Py, Python software for advanced automated timelapse experiments. We provide proof-of-principle of a user-friendly framework that increases the tunability and flexibility when setting up and running fluorescence timelapse microscopy experiments. Importantly, CyberSco.Py combines real-time image analysis with automation capability, which allows users to create conditional, event-based experiments in which the imaging acquisition parameters and the status of various devices can be changed automatically based on the image analysis. We exemplify the relevance of CyberSco.Py to cell biology using several use case experiments with budding yeast. We anticipate that CyberSco.Py could be used to address the growing need for smart microscopy systems to implement more informative quantitative cell biology experiments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Chiron","given":"Lionel"},{"family":"Bec","given":"Matthias Le"},{"family":"Cordier","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Pouzet","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Milunov","given":"Dimitrije"},{"family":"Banderas","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Meglio","given":"Jean-Marc Di"},{"family":"Sorre","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Hersen","given":"Pascal"}],"citation-key":"chiron2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.03.16.484589","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,16]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Here we performed whole-genome sequencing analyses of 426 individuals—comprising 50 ethnolinguistic groups, including previously unsampled populations—to explore the breadth of genomic diversity across Africa. We uncovered more than 3 million previously undescribed variants, most of which were found among individuals from newly sampled ethnolinguistic groups, as well as 62 previously unreported loci that are under strong selection, which were predominantly found in genes that are involved in viral immunity, DNA repair and metabolism. We observed complex patterns of ancestral admixture and putative-damaging and novel variation, both within and between populations, alongside evidence that Zambia was a likely intermediate site along the routes of expansion of Bantu-speaking populations. Pathogenic variants in genes that are currently characterized as medically relevant were uncommon—but in other genes, variants denoted as ‘likely pathogenic’ in the ClinVar database were commonly observed. Collectively, these findings refine our current understanding of continental migration, identify gene flow and the response to human disease as strong drivers of genome-level population variation, and underscore the scientific imperative for a broader characterization of the genomic diversity of African individuals to understand human ancestry and improve health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Choudhury","given":"Ananyo"},{"family":"Aron","given":"Shaun"},{"family":"Botigué","given":"Laura R."},{"family":"Sengupta","given":"Dhriti"},{"family":"Botha","given":"Gerrit"},{"family":"Bensellak","given":"Taoufik"},{"family":"Wells","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Kumuthini","given":"Judit"},{"family":"Shriner","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Fakim","given":"Yasmina J."},{"family":"Ghoorah","given":"Anisah W."},{"family":"Dareng","given":"Eileen"},{"family":"Odia","given":"Trust"},{"family":"Falola","given":"Oluwadamilare"},{"family":"Adebiyi","given":"Ezekiel"},{"family":"Hazelhurst","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Mazandu","given":"Gaston"},{"family":"Nyangiri","given":"Oscar A."},{"family":"Mbiyavanga","given":"Mamana"},{"family":"Benkahla","given":"Alia"},{"family":"Kassim","given":"Samar K."},{"family":"Mulder","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Adebamowo","given":"Sally N."},{"family":"Chimusa","given":"Emile R."},{"family":"Muzny","given":"Donna"},{"family":"Metcalf","given":"Ginger"},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Rotimi","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Ramsay","given":"Michèle"},{"family":"Adeyemo","given":"Adebowale A."},{"family":"Lombard","given":"Zané"},{"family":"Hanchard","given":"Neil A."}],"citation-key":"choudhury2020","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2859-7","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7831","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s)","number":"7831","page":"741-748","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"High-depth African genomes inform human migration and health","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2859-7","volume":"586"},

  {"id":"cimorelli2021","abstract":"The particle size distribution (PSD) of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and other submicron particles in biofluids is commonly measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS). A new technique for measuring the PSD is microfluidic resistive pulse sensing (MRPS). Because specific guidelines for measuring EVs together with other particles in biofluids with MRPS are lacking, we developed an operating procedure to reproducibly measure the PSD. The PSDs of particles in human plasma, conditioned medium of PC3 prostate cancer cell line (PC3 CM), and human urine were measured with MRPS (nCS1, Spectradyne LLC) to investigate: (i) the optimal diluent that reduces the interfacial tension of the sample while keeping EVs intact, (ii) the lower limit of detection (LoD) of particle size, (iii) the reproducibility of the PSD, (iv) the optimal dilution for measuring the PSD, and (v) the agreement in measured concentration between microfluidic cartridges with overlapping detection ranges. We found that the optimal diluent is 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline. Based on the shape of the PSD, which is expected to follow a power-law function within the full detection range, we obtained a lower LoD of 75 nm for plasma and PC3 CM and 65 nm for urine. Normalized PSDs are reproducible (R2 > 0.950) at dilutions between 10–100x for plasma, 5–20x for PC3 CM, and 2–4x for urine. Furthermore, sample dilution does not impact the dilution-corrected concentration when the microfluidic cartridges are operated within their specified concentration ranges. PSDs from microfluidic cartridges with overlapping detection ranges agreed well (R2 > 0.936) and when combined the overall PSD spanned 5 orders of magnitude of measured concentration. Based on these findings, we have developed operating guidelines to reproducibly measure the PSD of EVs together with other particles in biofluids with MRPS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Cimorelli","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Nieuwland","given":"Rienk"},{"family":"Varga","given":"Zoltán"},{"family":"Pol","given":"Edwin","dropping-particle":"van der"}],"citation-key":"cimorelli2021","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0249603","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e0249603","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Standardized procedure to measure the size distribution of extracellular vesicles together with other particles in biofluids with microfluidic resistive pulse sensing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249603","volume":"16"},

Its resolution is determined by the migration distance at the collection plane and by the fineness of the filament occupied by each protein species. Filaments undergo spreading due to a number of different phenomena, among which electrokinetics and electrohydrodynamics are known to be important. In the first of these, differences in migration velocity between the ionic species give rise to local variations in pH and electrical conductivity near the protein filament. In the second, the local change in electrical conductivity distorts the electric field, thus inducing shear stress in the liquid and creating a local flow pattern.

  {"id":"cnossen2014","abstract":"Numerous biophysical techniques such as magnetic tweezers, flow stretching assays, or tethered particle motion assays rely on the tracking of spherical beads to obtain quantitative information about the individual biomolecules to which these beads are bound. The determination of these beads’ coordinates from video-based images typically forms an essential component of these techniques. Recent advances in camera technology permit the simultaneous imaging of many beads, greatly increasing the information that can be captured in a single experiment. However, computational aspects such as frame capture rates or tracking algorithms often limit the rapid determination of such beads’ coordinates. Here, we present a scalable and open source software framework to accelerate bead localization calculations based on the CUDA parallel computing framework. Within this framework, we implement the Quadrant Interpolation algorithm in order to accurately and simultaneously track hundreds of beads in real time using consumer hardware. In doing so, we show that the scatter derived from the bead tracking algorithms remains close to the theoretical optimum defined by the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound. We also explore the trade-offs between processing speed, size of the region-of-interests utilized, and tracking bias, highlighting in passing a bias in tracking along the optical axis that has previously gone unreported. To demonstrate the practical application of this software, we demonstrate how its implementation on magnetic tweezers can accurately track (with ∼1 nm standard deviation) 228 DNA-tethered beads at 58 Hz. These advances will facilitate the development and use of high-throughput single-molecule approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Cnossen","given":"J.

AUC has broad applications for the study of biomacromolecules in a wide range of solvents and over a wide range of solute concentrations. Three optical systems are available for the analytical ultracentrifuge (absorbance, interference, and fluorescence) that permit precise and selective observation of sedimentation in real time. In particular, the fluorescence system provides a new way to extend the scope of AUC to probe the behavior of biological molecules in complex mixtures and at high solute concentrations. In sedimentation velocity (SV), the movement of solutes in high centrifugal fields is interpreted using hydrodynamic theory to define the size, shape, and interactions of macromolecules. Sedimentation equilibrium (SE) is a thermodynamic method where equilibrium concentration gradients at lower centrifugal fields are analyzed to define molecule mass, assembly stoichiometry, association constants, and solution nonideality. Using specialized sample cells and modern analysis software, researchers can use SV to determine the homogeneity of a sample and define whether it undergoes concentration-dependent association reactions. Subsequently, more thorough model-dependent analysis of velocity and equilibrium experiments can provide a detailed picture of the nature of the species present in solution and their interactions.","author":[{"family":"Cole","given":"James L."},{"family":"Lary","given":"Jeffrey W."},{"family":"P Moody","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Laue","given":"Thomas M."}],"citation-key":"cole2008","container-title":"Methods in Cell Biology","container-title-short":"Methods Cell Biol","DOI":"10.1016/S0091-679X(07)84006-4","ISSN":"0091-679X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"eng","page":"143-179","PMCID":"PMC2711687","PMID":"17964931","source":"PubMed","title":"Analytical ultracentrifugation: sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium","title-short":"Analytical ultracentrifugation","type":"article-journal","volume":"84"},

Reductionism and emergence play an intertwined role in the everyday life of the physicist, yet we rarely stop to contemplate their relationship: indeed, the two are often regarded as conflicting world-views of science. I argue that in practice, they compliment one-another, forming an awkward alliance in a fashion envisioned by the Renaissance scientist, Francis Bacon. Looking at the historical record in classical and quantum physics, I discuss how emergence fits into a reductionist view of nature. Often, a deep understanding of reductionist physics depends on the understanding of its emergent consequences. Thus the concept of energy was unknown to Newton, Leibnitz, Lagrange or Hamilton, because they did not understand heat. Similarly, the understanding of the weak force awaited an understanding of the Meissner effect in superconductivity. Emergence can thus be likened to an encrypted consequence of reductionism. Taking examples from current research, including topological insulators and strange metals, I show that the convection between emergence and reductionism continues to provide a powerful driver for frontier scientific research, linking the lab with the cosmos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Coleman","given":"Piers"}],"citation-key":"coleman2017","container-title":"arXiv:1702.06884 [cond-mat, physics:physics]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,7]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Emergence and Reductionism: an awkward Baconian alliance","title-short":"Emergence and Reductionism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06884"},

Here, an experimental and computational pipeline combining lattice light sheet microscopy, FRAP, and numerical simulations, offering rapid and minimally invasive quantification of molecular dynamics with respect to 3D cell morphology is presented.

Quantitation of antigen levels is a reliable method to study effects of drug administration, worm burden and anti-fecundity mechanisms. Moreover, the ratio of CAA and circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) is postulated to facilitate identification of either Schistosoma mansoni or Schistosoma haematobium infections. The UCP-LF assays allow simultaneous detection of multiple targets on a single strip, a valuable feature for antibody detection assays. Although antibody detection in endemic regions is not a useful tool to diagnose active infections, it gains potential when the ratio of different classes of antibody specific for the parasite/disease can be determined. The UCP-LF antibody assay format allows this type of multiplexing, including testing a linear array of up to 20 different targets. Multiple test spots would allow detection of specific antibodies, e.g. against different Schistosoma species or other pathogens as soil-transmitted helminths. Concluding, the different UCP-LF based assays for diagnosis of schistosomiasis provide a collection of tests with relatively low complexity and high sensitivity, covering the full range of diagnostics needed in control programmes for mapping, screening and monitoring.","author":[{"family":"Corstjens","given":"Paul L.

  {"id":"couch2021","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small cargo‐bearing vesicles released by cells into the extracellular space. The field of EVs has grown exponentially over the past two decades; this growth follows the realisation that EVs are not simply a waste disposal system as had originally been suggested by some, but also a complex cell‐to‐cell communication mechanism. Indeed, EVs have been shown to transfer functional cargo between cells and can influence several biological processes. These small biological particles are also deregulated in disease. As we approach the 75th anniversary of the first experiments in which EVs were unknowingly isolated, it seems right to take stock and look back on how the field started, and has since exploded into its current state. Here we review the early experiments, summarise key findings that have propelled the field, describe the growth of an organised EV community, discuss the current state of the field, and identify key challenges that need to be addressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Couch","given":"Yvonne"},{"family":"Buzàs","given":"Edit I."},{"family":"Vizio","given":"Dolores Di"},{"family":"Gho","given":"Yong Song"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Andrew F."},{"family":"Lötvall","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Raposo","given":"Graça"},{"family":"Stahl","given":"Philip D."},{"family":"Théry","given":"Clotilde"},{"family":"Witwer","given":"Kenneth W."},{"family":"Carter","given":"David R.

  {"id":"coumans2014","abstract":"Introduction\nThe size of extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be determined with a tunable resistive pulse sensor (TRPS). Because the sensing pore diameter varies from pore to pore, the minimum detectable diameter also varies. The aim of this study is to determine and improve the reproducibility of TRPS measurements.\n\nMethods\nExperiments were performed with the qNano system (Izon) using beads and a standard urine vesicle sample. With a combination of voltage and stretch that yields a high blockade height, we investigate whether the minimum detected diameter is more reproducible when we configure the instrument targeting (a) fixed stretch and voltage, or (b) fixed blockade height.\n\nResults\nDaily measurements with a fixed stretch and voltage (n=102) on a standard urine sample show a minimum detected vesicle diameter of 128±19 nm [mean±standard deviation; coefficient of variation (CV) 14.8%]. The vesicle concentration was 2.4·109±3.8·109 vesicles/mL (range 1.4·108–1.8·1010). When we compared setting a fixed stretch and voltage to setting a fixed blockade height on 3 different pores, we found a minimum detected vesicle diameter of 118 nm (CV 15.5%, stretch), and 123 nm (CV 4.5%, blockade height). The detected vesicle concentration was 3.2–8.2·108 vesicles/mL with fixed stretch and 6.4–7.8·108 vesicles/mL with fixed blockade height.\n\nSummary/conclusion\nPore-to-pore variability is the cause of the variation in minimum detected size when setting a fixed stretch and voltage. The reproducibility of the minimum detectable diameter is much improved by setting a fixed blockade height.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Coumans","given":"Frank A.

The success of an LNP product largely depends on the systematic optimisation of the four lipidic components, namely the ionisable lipid, PEG lipid, structural and helper lipids. However, the\n              in vitro\n              screening of novel lipidic components and LNP compositions is limited by the low-throughput of LNP preparation.

Despite these efforts, there is still a scarcity in empirical evidence in terms of how patented academic inventions are commercialised over time. This paper extends previous work on academic commercialisation by tracing patent ownership transfers longitudinally. We develop a conceptual framework of academic patent transfer modes that distinguishes between patents transferred through the efforts of the researchers themselves (autonomous mode), through university support intermediaries (bridge mode) or via companies (corporate mode). The framework makes it possible to record knowledge transfer between academic inventors and external innovators at the time of invention (t0), patent filing (t1), and any subsequent time point (tn). Our results indicate that a majority of the patented inventions are transferred from the inventors to outside-of-academe entities.

In the ideal case, iSCAT is limited by shot noise such that collection of more photons should extend its detection sensitivity to biomolecules of arbitrarily low mass. However, a number of technical noise sources combined with speckle-like background fluctuations have restricted the detection limit in iSCAT. Here, we show that an unsupervised machine learning isolation forest algorithm for anomaly detection pushes the mass sensitivity limit by a factor of 4 to below 10 kDa.

  {"id":"danielhoughton2023","abstract":"Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) electrocatalysts are typically Pt or Pt alloy nanoparticles (NPs) supported on high surface area carbon black powders, the latter which contain a significant sp2 carbon component. One of the barriers to PEMFC commercialisation is the lifetime of the catalyst-support system, which should be at least 5,000 hours for automotive applications.[1] During the start-up and shut-down of the PEMFC, the cathode is subjected to significant oxidative potentials (greater than 1 V vs RHE) which can lead to corrosion of the predominantly sp2 bonded carbon support, a key factor which can limit the lifetime of PEMFCs. [2]\n \n High quality boron doped diamond (BDD) is an sp3 bonded network with above 1:1000 B:C ratio, which is required for metal-like electronic conductivity. BDD has many favourable properties for electrochemical experiments, most notably: higher electrochemical corrosion resistance with respect to sp2 carbons, low background currents, and a wide aqueous solvent window.[3] In this work we first explore the electrochemical corrosion stability of BDD when undergoing electrochemical cycling in acid solutions. To achieve this BDD substrates (BDD TEM grid) suitable for both electrochemical experiments and high magnification (single atom resolution) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were produced using precision ion polishing (Gatan PIPS-II). The surface was characterised using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to ensure the polishing process did not significantly alter the diamond substrate. Under aggressive electrochemical potential cycling in perchloric acid and sulfuric acid solutions, both TEM morphological analysis and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) thickness measurements showed no evidence of BDD corrosion. [4]\n \n The BDD-TEM substrate was then used as a platform for investigating the degradation of a PEMFC electrocatalyst (Pt NPs) under accelerated stress testing (AST) [1] conditions on an atomic level, using the corrosion free carbon support. This enables the influence of other degradation pathways [2] (such as aggregation, Ostwald Ripening & direct dissolution) to be explored in more detail, free from issues associated with corrosion of the support. Pt NPs, in the size range 1 – 4 nm, were sputter coated onto the BDD TEM grid. Identical location ex-situ TEM (IL-TEM)[5] in combination with image analysis was used to probe NP changes e.g. size, shape, position, on an individual basis before, and after, AST (Fig. 1, which contains c.a. 200 NPs for analysis). Such measurements were complemented by Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectroscopy analysis for any dissolved Pt, and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry measurements of the Pt to highlight changes in electrocatalytic behaviour (hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction) due to AST cycling.\n Figure 1 – High magnification annular dark field (ADF) identical location images of Pt NPs, a) Pt/BDD before AST, b) Pt NPs after AST, c) Cyclic voltammogram of the 1000 cycle AST from 0.8 to 1.4 V vs Ag|AgCl (1.6 to 1.6 V vs RHE).\n References: \n \n U.S. D.O.E.; Multi-Year Research, Development, and Demonstration Plan; 2016; 3.4 Fuel Cells.\n \n \n Mayrhofer, K.J.J.; et al.; Beilstein J.

This framework is used to assess monitoring possibilities for the Convention on Biological Diversity “2020” indicators, and those of 11 other international environmental agreements. Of the 186 indicators in these 12 environmental agreements, 69 (37%) require monitoring by professional scientists, whereas 117 (63%) can involve community members as “citizen scientists.” Promoting “community-based” and “citizen science” approaches could significantly enrich monitoring progress within global environmental conventions.

  {"id":"dapp2021","abstract":"Self-evaluations play an important role in various fields of study, specifically in research on metacognition and self-concept. Although the assumption that self-evaluations as known from metacognitive monitoring and academic self-concept are related has received wide agreement, the nature of such a relationship has only rarely been investigated. In the current study, the individual-differences approach that has occasionally addressed this association is discussed and extended twofold. For one, a novel way to compare metacognition and self-concept is presented by computing a self-concept bias—analogous to metacognition research. For another, the study targeted a younger population, namely first-grade children. In line with previous studies, the results confirmed a weak relation between metacognitive monitoring and academic self-concept when relating the two constructs at the absolute level of confidence. However, relating the constructs by means of the respective biases revealed a more substantial association. Thus, while previous studies have assumed the common thread between metacognition and self-concept to be best explained by a general confidence trait, the present study suggests the accuracy of self-evaluations to be at stake instead. Hence, by introducing a method to quantify a bias in self-concept, the current study proposes a new and promising way to compare and relate the constructs of metacognition and self-concept.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Dapp","given":"Laura C."},{"family":"Roebers","given":"Claudia M."}],"citation-key":"dapp2021","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0250845","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e0250845","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Metacognition and self-concept: Elaborating on a construct relation in first-grade children","title-short":"Metacognition and self-concept","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250845","volume":"16"},

The indigenous development of such a calendar in north-western Europe is possible, but an Eastern Mediterranean origin is also considered.

  {"id":"deamer2019","abstract":"Two processes required for life's origin are condensation reactions that produce essential biopolymers by a nonenzymatic reaction, and self-assembly of membranous compartments that encapsulate the polymers into populations of protocells. Because life today thrives not just in the temperate ocean and lakes but also in extreme conditions of temperature, salinity, and pH, there is a general assumption that any form of liquid water would be sufficient to support the origin of life as long as there are sources of chemical energy and simple organic compounds. We argue here that the first forms of life would be physically and chemically fragile and would be strongly affected by ionic solutes and pH. A hypothesis emerges from this statement that hot springs associated with volcanic land masses have an ionic composition more conducive to self-assembly and polymerization than seawater. Here we have compared the ionic solutes of seawater with those of terrestrial hot springs. We then describe preliminary experimental results that show how the hypothesis can be tested in a prebiotic analog environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Deamer","given":"David"},{"family":"Damer","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Kompanichenko","given":"Vladimir"}],"citation-key":"deamer2019","container-title":"Astrobiology","DOI":"10.1089/ast.2018.1979","ISSN":"1531-1074","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,9]]},"page":"1523-1537","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers","source":"liebertpub.com (Atypon)","title":"Hydrothermal Chemistry and the Origin of Cellular Life","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2018.1979","volume":"19"},

Unfortunately, whereas biological effects of EV-mediated RNA transfer are abundantly studied, regulatory pathways and mechanisms remain poorly defined due to a lack of suitable readout systems. Here, we describe a highly-sensitive CRISPR-Cas9-based reporter system that allows direct functional study of EV-mediated transfer of small non-coding RNA molecules at single-cell resolution. Using this CRISPR operated stoplight system for functional intercellular RNA exchange (CROSS-FIRE) we uncover various genes involved in EV subtype biogenesis that play a regulatory role in RNA transfer. Moreover we identify multiple genes involved in endocytosis and intracellular membrane trafficking that strongly regulate EV-mediated functional RNA delivery. Altogether, this approach allows the elucidation of regulatory mechanisms in EV-mediated RNA transfer at the level of EV biogenesis, endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and RNA delivery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Jong","given":"Olivier G.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Daniel E."},{"family":"Mäger","given":"Imre"},{"family":"Willms","given":"Eduard"},{"family":"Garcia-Guerra","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Gitz-Francois","given":"Jerney J."},{"family":"Lefferts","given":"Juliet"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Dhanu"},{"family":"Steenbeek","given":"Sander C."},{"family":"Rheenen","given":"Jacco","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"El Andaloussi","given":"Samir"},{"family":"Schiffelers","given":"Raymond M."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Matthew J.

The enzyme consumes hydrogen peroxide, and then gold (III) ions are added to generate gold nanoparticles. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide dictates the state of aggregation of gold nanoparticles. This allows for the naked-eye detection of analytes by observing the generation of blue- or red-colored gold nanoparticle solutions.

We confirmed the internalization of EVs by mono-DCs and the down-regulation of microRNA mRNA targets in treated mono-DCs. Differences in surface markers of dendritic cells cultivated in the presence of EVs indicated that their content disrupts the maturation process. Additionally, microRNAs known to interfere with dendritic cell function, and detected in EVs, matched microRNAs from squamous cell carcinoma patients' plasma: miR-17-5p in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, miR-21 in oral squamous cell carcinoma, miR-16, miR-24, and miR-181a circulating in both oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and miR-23b, which has not been previously described in plasma of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, was found in plasma from patients with these cancer subtypes.

  {"id":"deridder2024","abstract":"This paper offers a unified explanation for the slowdown of productivity growth, the decline in business dynamism, and the rise of market power. Using a quantitative framework, I show that the rise of intangible inputs, such as software, can explain these trends. Intangibles reduce marginal costs and raise fixed costs, which gives firms with high-intangible adoption a competitive advantage, in turn deterring other firms from entering.

  {"id":"deschout2014","abstract":"Cell-derived membrane vesicles that are released in biofluids, like blood or saliva, are emerging as potential non-invasive biomarkers for diseases, such as cancer. Techniques capable of measuring the size and concentration of membrane vesicles directly in biofluids are urgently needed. Fluorescence single particle tracking microscopy has the potential of doing exactly that by labelling the membrane vesicles with a fluorescent label and analysing their Brownian motion in the biofluid. However, an unbound dye in the biofluid can cause high background intensity that strongly biases the fluorescence single particle tracking size and concentration measurements. While such background intensity can be avoided with light sheet illumination, current set-ups require specialty sample holders that are not compatible with high-throughput diagnostics. Here, a microfluidic chip with integrated light sheet illumination is reported, and accurate fluorescence single particle tracking size and concentration measurements of membrane vesicles in cell culture medium and in interstitial fluid collected from primary human breast tumours are demonstrated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Deschout","given":"Hendrik"},{"family":"Raemdonck","given":"Koen"},{"family":"Stremersch","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Maoddi","given":"Pietro"},{"family":"Mernier","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Renaud","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Jiguet","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Hendrix","given":"An"},{"family":"Bracke","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Broecke","given":"Rudy Van","dropping-particle":"den"},{"family":"Röding","given":"Magnus"},{"family":"Rudemo","given":"Mats"},{"family":"Demeester","given":"Jo"},{"family":"Smedt","given":"Stefaan C.

  {"id":"devasenathipathy2002","abstract":"We have applied particle tracking techniques to obtain spatially resolved velocity measurements in electrokinetic flow devices. Both micrometer-resolution particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) and particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) techniques have been used to quantify and study flow phenomena in electrokinetic systems applicable to microfluidic bioanalytical devices. To make the flow measurements quantitative, we performed a series of seed particle calibration experiments. First, we measure the electroosmotic wall mobility of a borosilicate rectangular capillary (40 by 400 μm) using current monitoring. In addition to this wall mobility characterization, we apply PTV to determine the electrophoretic mobilities of more than 1000 fluorescent microsphere particles in aqueous buffer solutions. Particles from this calibrated particle/buffer mixture are then introduced into two electrokinetic flow systems for particle tracking flow experiments. In these experiments, we use micro-PIV, together with an electric field prediction, to obtain electroosmotic flow bulk fluid velocity measurements. The first example flow system is a microchannel intersection where we demonstrate a detailed documentation of the similitude between the electrical fields and the velocity fields in an electrokinetic system with uniform zeta potential, ζ. In the second system, we apply micro-PIV to a microchannel system with nonuniform ζ. The latter experiment provides a simultaneous measurement of two distinct wall mobilities within the microchannel.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Devasenathipathy","given":"Shankar"},{"family":"Santiago","given":"Juan G."},{"family":"Takehara","given":"Kohsei"}],"citation-key":"devasenathipathy2002","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

  {"id":"dhondt2020","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EV) are increasingly being recognized as important vehicles of intercellular communication and promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer. Despite this enormous clinical potential, the plethora of methods to separate EV from biofluids, providing material of highly variable purity, and lacking knowledge regarding methodological repeatability pose a barrier to clinical translation. Urine is considered an ideal proximal fluid for the study of EV in urological cancers due to its direct contact with the urogenital system. We demonstrate that density-based fractionation of urine by bottom-up Optiprep density gradient centrifugation separates EV and soluble proteins with high specificity and repeatability. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of urinary EV (uEV) in men with benign and malignant prostate disease allowed us to significantly expand the known human uEV proteome with high specificity and identifies a unique biological profile in prostate cancer not uncovered by the analysis of soluble proteins. In addition, profiling the proteome of EV separated from prostate tumour conditioned medium and matched uEV confirms the specificity of the identified uEV proteome for prostate cancer. Finally, a comparative proteomic analysis with uEV from patients with bladder and renal cancer provided additional evidence of the selective enrichment of protein signatures in uEV reflecting their respective cancer tissues of origin. In conclusion, this study identifies hundreds of previously undetected proteins in uEV of prostate cancer patients and provides a powerful toolbox to map uEV content and contaminants ultimately allowing biomarker discovery in urological cancers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Dhondt","given":"Bert"},{"family":"Geeurickx","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Tulkens","given":"Joeri"},{"family":"Deun","given":"Jan Van"},{"family":"Vergauwen","given":"Glenn"},{"family":"Lippens","given":"Lien"},{"family":"Miinalainen","given":"Ilkka"},{"family":"Rappu","given":"Pekka"},{"family":"Heino","given":"Jyrki"},{"family":"Ost","given":"Piet"},{"family":"Lumen","given":"Nicolaas"},{"family":"Wever","given":"Olivier De"},{"family":"Hendrix","given":"An"}],"citation-key":"dhondt2020","container-title":"Journal of Extracellular Vesicles","DOI":"10.1080/20013078.2020.1736935","ISSN":"2001-3078","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"1736935","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Unravelling the proteomic landscape of extracellular vesicles in prostate cancer by density-based fractionation of urine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20013078.2020.1736935","volume":"9"},

However, the requirement for good quality microscopes and well-trained personnel often lead to inaccurate diagnosis, especially in cases of mixed infections or low parasitemia. Although PCR-based tests can help in these situations, this technique requires large and sensitive equipments, being unsuitable for point of care (POC) settings. A myriad of POC diagnostic tests have being developed in the last years, relying on molecular methods but also on novel strategies.

Here, we present a 3D printed, self-contained super-resolution microscope with a price tag below 1000 $ including the objective and a cellphone. The system relies on a cellphone to both acquire and process images as well as control the hardware, and a photonic-chip enabled illumination. The system exhibits 100nm optical resolution using single-molecule localization microscopy and can provide live super-resolution imaging using light intensity fluctuation methods. Furthermore, due to its compactness, we demonstrate its potential use inside bench-top incubators and high biological safety level environments imaging SARS-CoV-2 viroids.

Findings show that greater patent uncertainty has a depressing effect on innovation rates. Moreover, our findings reveal important differences between the short-run and long-run effects and between overall patents and utility patents.

Mass or position are estimated from weak signals, coherently scattered from nanoparticles or single molecules, and interfered with a co-propagating reference. In this work, we perform a statistical analysis and derive lower bounds on the measurement precision of the parameters of interest from shot-noise limited images. This is done by computing the classical Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) for localization and mass estimation, using a precise vectorial model of interferometric imaging techniques. We then derive fundamental bounds valid for any imaging system, based on the quantum Cramér–Rao formalism. This approach enables a rigorous and quantitative comparison of common techniques such as interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT), coherent brightfield microscopy, and dark-field microscopy. In particular, we demonstrate that the light collection geometry in iSCAT greatly increases the axial position sensitivity, and that the Quantum CRB for mass estimation yields a minimum relative estimation error of , where N is the number of collected scattered photons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Dong","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Maestre","given":"Dante"},{"family":"Conrad-Billroth","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Juffmann","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"dong2021","container-title":"Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"dragovic2011","abstract":"Cellular microvesicles and nanovesicles (exosomes) are involved in many disease processes and have major potential as biomarkers. However, developments in this area are constrained by limitations in the technology available for their measurement. Here we report on the use of fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to rapidly size and phenotype cellular vesicles. In this system vesicles are visualized by light scattering using a light microscope. A video is taken, and the NTA software tracks the brownian motion of individual vesicles and calculates their size and total concentration. Using human placental vesicles and plasma, we have demonstrated that NTA can measure cellular vesicles as small as ∼50 nm and is far more sensitive than conventional flow cytometry (lower limit ∼300 nm). By combining NTA with fluorescence measurement we have demonstrated that vesicles can be labeled with specific antibody-conjugated quantum dots, allowing their phenotype to be determined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dragovic","given":"Rebecca A."},{"family":"Gardiner","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Alexandra S."},{"family":"Tannetta","given":"Dionne S."},{"family":"Ferguson","given":"David J.P."},{"family":"Hole","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Carr","given":"Bob"},{"family":"Redman","given":"Christopher W.G."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Adrian L."},{"family":"Dobson","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Sargent","given":"Ian L."}],"citation-key":"dragovic2011","container-title":"Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine","container-title-short":"Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.nano.2011.04.003","ISSN":"15499634","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12]]},"language":"en","page":"780-788","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sizing and phenotyping of cellular vesicles using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1549963411001638","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"driedonks2018","abstract":"The release and uptake of nano-sized extracellular vesicles (EV) is a highly conserved means of intercellular communication. The molecular composition of EV, and thereby their signaling function to target cells, is regulated by cellular activation and differentiation stimuli. EV are regarded as snapshots of cells and are, therefore, in the limelight as biomarkers for disease. Although research on EV-associated RNA has predominantly focused on microRNAs, the transcriptome of EV consists of multiple classes of small non-coding RNAs with potential gene-regulatory functions. It is not known whether environmental cues imposed on cells induce specific changes in a broad range of EV-associated RNA classes. Here, we investigated whether immune-activating or -suppressing stimuli imposed on primary dendritic cells affected the release of various small noncoding RNAs via EV. The small RNA transcriptomes of highly pure EV populations free from ribonucleoprotein particles were analyzed by RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR. Immune stimulus-specific changes were found in the miRNA, snoRNA, and Y-RNA content of EV from dendritic cells, whereas tRNA and snRNA levels were much less affected. Only part of the changes in EV-RNA content reflected changes in cellular RNA, which urges caution in interpreting EV as snapshots of cells. By comprehensive analysis of RNA obtained from highly purified EV, we demonstrate that multiple RNA classes contribute to genetic messages conveyed via EV. The identification of multiple RNA classes that display cell stimulation-dependent association with EV is the prelude to unraveling the function and biomarker potential of these EV-RNAs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Driedonks","given":"Tom A.

  {"id":"du2010","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The surge of studies on artiﬁcial and natural nanoparticles has revealed a new world for engineering and life sciences, but in most instances, the small scale has made their number-concentration determination in liquids a challenging problem. Former success has mostly been limited to special particles measured by indirect techniques. A new approach is required for this determination to facilitate the production and application of nanoparticles in different systems.\nRESULT: Here, an approach is described using a nanoparticle tracking system based on Brownian motion, which can be used to determine the number-concentration of nanoparticles, including viruses, in liquids on-line. Extensive analysis showed the inﬂuence of suspension concentration and particle size on the accuracy of measurements. Natural nanoparticles of Adenovirus and several types of artiﬁcial nanoparticles, including precision nanobeads, uniform inorganic silica microspheres, monodisperse gold metal colloids and aggregated Aerosil nanoparticles, were measured and compared by counting the monitored particle number obtained using light scattered from individual particles, from which the particle number-concentration, the product yield and the aggregation could be evaluated.\nCONCLUSION: This approach was compared with the mathematical calculation method and the emission spectrophotometry technique used for practical applications. The results showed this new approach had improved accuracy for determination of the particle number-concentration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Du","given":"Shangfeng"},{"family":"Kendall","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Morris","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Sweet","given":"Clive"}],"citation-key":"du2010","container-title":"Journal of Chemical Technology & Biotechnology","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"dulin2014","abstract":"The possibility to observe microsecond dynamics at the sub-micron scale, opened by recent technological advances in fast camera sensors, will affect many biophysical studies based on particle tracking in optical microscopy. A main limiting factor for further development of fast video microscopy remains the illumination of the sample, which must deliver sufficient light to the camera to allow microsecond exposure times. Here we systematically compare the main illumination systems employed in holographic tracking microscopy, and we show that a superluminescent diode and a modulated laser diode perform the best in terms of image quality and acquisition speed, respectively. In particular, we show that the simple and inexpensive laser illumination enables less than 1ms camera exposure time at high magnification on a large field of view without coherence image artifacts, together with a good hologram quality that allows nm-tracking of microscopic beads to be performed. This comparison of sources can guide in choosing the most efficient illumination system with respect to the specific application.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dulin","given":"David"},{"family":"Barland","given":"Stephane"},{"family":"Hachair","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Pedaci","given":"Francesco"}],"citation-key":"dulin2014","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0107335","editor":[{"family":"Waigh","given":"Tom"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,24]]},"language":"en","page":"e107335","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Efficient Illumination for Microsecond Tracking Microscopy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0107335","volume":"9"},

Since only the plane of the specimen that is being imaged is illuminated, this technique is particularly suited to time-lapse 3-D imaging of sensitive biological systems where photobleaching and phototoxicity must be kept to a minimum, and it could also be applied to image microfluidic technology for lab-on-a-chip, cytometry and other applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Dunsby","given":"C."}],"citation-key":"dunsby2008","container-title":"Optics Express","container-title-short":"Opt.

Nevertheless, a large-scale assessment of contemporary hunter-gatherer societies has established a consistent pattern of unrelated individuals living together. Dyble et al. used a modeling approach to suggest that a possible answer to this conundrum is that cohabitation choices are being governed equally by men and women.\nScience, this issue p. 796\nThe social organization of mobile hunter-gatherers has several derived features, including low within-camp relatedness and fluid meta-groups. Although these features have been proposed to have provided the selective context for the evolution of human hypercooperation and cumulative culture, how such a distinctive social system may have emerged remains unclear. We present an agent-based model suggesting that, even if all individuals in a community seek to live with as many kin as possible, within-camp relatedness is reduced if men and women have equal influence in selecting camp members. Our model closely approximates observed patterns of co-residence among Agta and Mbendjele BaYaka hunter-gatherers. Our results suggest that pair-bonding and increased sex egalitarianism in human evolutionary history may have had a transformative effect on human social organization.\nAs human societies evolved, modeling reveals that allowing both males and females to choose camp members reduces relatedness.\nAs human societies evolved, modeling reveals that allowing both males and females to choose camp members reduces relatedness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Dyble","given":"M."},{"family":"Salali","given":"G.

Instagram is a very popular platform to share images with the option to categorise the images by certain tags.

The sample topic for this thesis has been veganfood and all associated posts from Instagram have been crawled.\nAfter the user data has been crawled a graph has been created to do further research with common social network analysis tools. The graph contained a total set of more than 26,000 nodes.\nTo identify opinion leaders from this graph, five di↵erent metrics have been applied, in particular PageRank, Betweenness centrality, Closeness Centrality, Degree and Eigen- vector centrality. After applying the di↵erent algorithms the results have been eval- uated and additionally an marketing expert with focus on social media analysed the results.\nThis project was able to figured out that it is possible to find opinion leaders by using the PageRank algorithm and that those opinion leaders have a very good value of en- gagement.

  {"id":"egloff2022","abstract":"Detection and imaging of RNA at the single-cell level is of utmost importance for fundamental research and clinical diagnostics. Current techniques of RNA analysis, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are long, complex, and expensive. Here, we report a methodology of amplified FISH (AmpliFISH) that enables simpler and faster RNA imaging using small and ultrabright dye-loaded polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized with DNA. We found that the small size of NPs (below 20 nm) was essential for their access to the intracellular mRNA targets in fixed permeabilized cells. Moreover, proper selection of the polymer matrix of DNA-NPs minimized nonspecific intracellular interactions. Optimized DNA-NPs enabled sequence-specific imaging of different mRNA targets (survivin, actin, and polyA tails), using a simple 1 h staining protocol. Encapsulation of cyanine and rhodamine dyes with bulky counterions yielded green-, red-, and far-red-emitting NPs that were 2–100-fold brighter than corresponding quantum dots. These NPs enabled multiplexed detection of three mRNA targets simultaneously, showing distinctive mRNA expression profiles in three cancer cell lines. Image analysis confirmed the single-particle nature of the intracellular signal, suggesting single-molecule sensitivity of the method. AmpliFISH was found to be semiquantitative, correlating with RT-qPCR. In comparison with the commercial locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based FISH technique, AmpliFISH provides 8–200-fold stronger signal (dependent on the NP color) and requires only three steps vs ∼20 steps together with a much shorter time. Thus, combination of bright fluorescent polymeric NPs with FISH yields a fast and sensitive single-cell transcriptomic analysis method for RNA research and clinical diagnostics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Egloff","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Melnychuk","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Cruz Da Silva","given":"Elisabete"},{"family":"Reisch","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Klymchenko","given":"Andrey S."}],"citation-key":"egloff2022","container-title":"ACS Nano","container-title-short":"ACS Nano","DOI":"10.1021/acsnano.1c09409","ISSN":"1936-0851","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"page":"1381-1394","publisher":"American Chemical Society","source":"ACS Publications","title":"Amplified Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization by Small and Bright Dye-Loaded Polymeric Nanoparticles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c09409","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"eiberg2008","abstract":"The human eye color is a quantitative trait displaying multifactorial inheritance. Several studies have shown that the OCA2 locus is the major contributor to the human eye color variation. By linkage analysis of a large Danish family, we finemapped the blue eye color locus to a 166 Kbp region within the HERC2 gene. By association analyses, we identified two SNPs within this region that were perfectly associated with the blue and brown eye colors: rs12913832 and rs1129038. Of these, rs12913832 is located 21.152 bp upstream from the OCA2 promoter in a highly conserved sequence in intron 86 of HERC2. The brown eye color allele of rs12913832 is highly conserved throughout a number of species. As shown by a Luciferase assays in cell cultures, the element significantly reduces the activity of the OCA2 promoter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that the two alleles bind different subsets of nuclear extracts. One single haplotype, represented by six polymorphic SNPs covering half of the 3′ end of the HERC2 gene, was found in 155 blue-eyed individuals from Denmark, and in 5 and 2 blue-eyed individuals from Turkey and Jordan, respectively. Hence, our data suggest a common founder mutation in an OCA2 inhibiting regulatory element as the cause of blue eye color in humans. In addition, an LOD score of Z = 4.21 between hair color and D14S72 was obtained in the large family, indicating that RABGGTA is a candidate gene for hair color.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Eiberg","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Troelsen","given":"Jesper"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Mette"},{"family":"Mikkelsen","given":"Annemette"},{"family":"Mengel-From","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Kjaer","given":"Klaus W."},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Lars"}],"citation-key":"eiberg2008","container-title":"Human Genetics","container-title-short":"Hum Genet","DOI":"10.1007/s00439-007-0460-x","ISSN":"1432-1203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"177-187","source":"Springer Link","title":"Blue eye color in humans may be caused by a perfectly associated founder mutation in a regulatory element located within the HERC2 gene inhibiting OCA2 expression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-007-0460-x","volume":"123"},

Based on interviews and surveys with hundreds of founders and investors and scores of accounts of entrepreneurial setbacks, his findings buck the conventional wisdom that the cause of start-up failure is either the founding team or the business idea. The author found six patterns that doomed ventures. Two were especially common: Bad bedfellows. Other parties besides the founders—like employees, strategic partners, and investors—can play a major role in a firm’s demise. Quincy Apparel, for instance, was undone by weak support from its investors and factory partners and inflexible employees. False starts. Many overlook a crucial step in the lean start-up process: researching customer needs before testing products. Like Triangulate, an online dating start-up, they keep rushing to launch fully functional offerings that don’t fit any market needs.

  {"id":"elsharkasy2020","abstract":"Over the past decades, a multitude of synthetic drug delivery systems has been developed and introduced to the market. However, applications of such systems are limited due to inefficiency, cytotoxicity and/or immunogenicity. At the same time, the field of natural drug carrier systems has grown rapidly. One of the most prominent examples of such natural carriers are extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are cell-derived membranous particles which play important roles in intercellular communication. EVs possess a number of characteristics that qualify them as promising vehicles for drug delivery. In order to take advantage of these attributes, an in-depth understanding of why EVs are such unique carrier systems and how we can exploit their qualities is pivotal. Here, we review unique EV features that are relevant for drug delivery and highlight emerging strategies to make use of those features for drug loading and targeted delivery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Elsharkasy","given":"Omnia M."},{"family":"Nordin","given":"Joel Z."},{"family":"Hagey","given":"Daniel W."},{"family":"Jong","given":"Olivier G.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Schiffelers","given":"Raymond M."},{"family":"Andaloussi","given":"Samir EL"},{"family":"Vader","given":"Pieter"}],"citation-key":"elsharkasy2020","collection-title":"Lipids in disease pathology, diagnosis & therapy","container-title":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","container-title-short":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.addr.2020.04.004","ISSN":"0169-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"332-343","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Extracellular vesicles as drug delivery systems: Why and how?","title-short":"Extracellular vesicles as drug delivery systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X20300247","volume":"159"},
  {"id":"erdbrugger","abstract":"The interest in extracellular vesicles (EVs) has grown exponentially over the last decade. Evolving evidence is demonstrating that these EVs are playing an important role in health and disease. They are involved in intercellular communication and have been shown to transfer proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This review focuses on the most commonly used techniques for detection of EVs, to include microparticles, 100–1,000 nm in size, and exosomes, 50–100 nm in size. Conventional flow cytometry is the most prevalent technique, but nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and resistive pulse sensing have also been used to detect EVs. The accurate measurement of these vesicles is challenged by size heterogeneity, low refractive index, and the lack of dynamic measurement range for most of the available technologies. Sample handling during the preanalytical phase can also affect the accuracy of measurements. Currently, there is not one single method which allows phenotyping, sizing, and enumerating the whole range of EVs and, therefore, providing all the necessary information to truly understand the biology of these particles. A combination of methods is probably needed which might also include electron and atomic force microscopy and full RNA, lipid, and protein profiling. © 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Erdbrügger","given":"Uta"},{"family":"Lannigan","given":"Joanne"}],"citation-key":"erdbrugger","container-title":"Cytometry Part A","DOI":"10.1002/cyto.a.22795","ISSN":"1552-4930","issue":"2","language":"en","page":"123-134","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Analytical challenges of extracellular vesicle detection: A comparison of different techniques","title-short":"Analytical challenges of extracellular vesicle detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cyto.a.22795","volume":"89"},

Novel studies have shed light on the essential roles of metabolic pathways, the microbiome, epithelial oxalate transporters, and adequate oxalate excretion to maintain oxalate homeostasis. In patients with primary or secondary hyperoxaluria, nephrolithiasis, acute or chronic oxalate nephropathy, or chronic kidney disease irrespective of aetiology, one or more of these elements are disrupted. The consequent impairment in oxalate homeostasis can trigger localized and systemic inflammation, progressive kidney disease and cardiovascular complications, including sudden cardiac death. Although kidney replacement therapy is the standard method for controlling elevated plasma oxalate concentrations in patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis, more research is needed to define effective elimination strategies at earlier stages of kidney disease. Beyond well-known interventions (such as dietary modifications), novel therapeutics (such as small interfering RNA gene silencers, recombinant oxalate-degrading enzymes and oxalate-degrading bacterial strains) hold promise to improve the outlook of patients with oxalate-related diseases. In addition, experimental evidence suggests that anti-inflammatory medications might represent another approach to mitigating or resolving oxalate-induced conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ermer","given":"Theresa"},{"family":"Nazzal","given":"Lama"},{"family":"Tio","given":"Maria Clarissa"},{"family":"Waikar","given":"Sushrut"},{"family":"Aronson","given":"Peter S."},{"family":"Knauf","given":"Felix"}],"citation-key":"ermer2022","container-title":"Nature Reviews Nephrology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Nephrol","DOI":"10.1038/s41581-022-00643-3","ISSN":"1759-507X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,3]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 Springer Nature Limited","page":"1-16","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Oxalate homeostasis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-022-00643-3"},

The role of government in relation to these two spheres is changing in apparently contradictory directions.  Governments are offering incentives, on the one hand, and pressing academic institutions, on the other, to go beyond performing the traditional functions of cultural memory, education and research, and make a more direct contribution to \"wealth creation\" (HMSO 1993).  Governments are also shifting their relationships to economic institutions, becoming both more and less involved.  In some countries with a laissez faire capitalist tradition such as the U.S. government is playing a greater role in innovation in the civilian economy (Etzkowitz 1994a) while in former socialist societies government has withdrawn from its previous position of total control of science and technology policy; adopting a stance more in accord with laissez faire principles.  Multi-national institutions such as the European Union, the World Bank and the U.N. are also moving to embrace concepts of knowledge based economic development that bring the knowledge, productive and regulatory spheres of society into new configurations.

It is also a major experimental challenge, particularly for small, nanometer-scale particles. Although methods such as confocal or ﬂuorescence microscopy oﬀer both high spatial resolution and high signal-to-background ratios, the ﬂuorescence emission lifetime limits the measurement speed, while photobleaching and thermal diﬀusion limit the duration of measurements. Here we present a tracking method based on elastic light scattering that enables long-duration measurements of nanoparticle dynamics at rates of thousands of frames per second. We contain the particles within a single-mode silica ﬁber having a subwavelength, nanoﬂuidic channel and illuminate them using the ﬁber's strongly conﬁned optical mode. The diﬀusing particles in this cylindrical geometry are continuously illuminated inside the collection focal plane. We show that the method can track unlabeled dielectric particles as small as 20 nm as well as individual cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) virions;26 nm in size and 4.6 megadaltons in mass;at rates of over 3 kHz for durations of tens of seconds. Our setup is easily incorporated into common optical microscopes and extends their detection range to nanometer-scale particles and macromolecules.

  {"id":"felton2021","abstract":"This paper reports a novel, negligible-cost and open-source process for the rapid prototyping of complex microfluidic devices in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using 3D-printed interconnecting microchannel scaffolds. These single-extrusion scaffolds are designed with interconnecting ends and used to quickly configure complex microfluidic systems before being embedded in PDMS to produce an imprint of the microfluidic configuration. The scaffolds are printed using common Material Extrusion (MEX) 3D printers and the limits, cost & reliability of the process are evaluated. The limits of standard MEX 3D-printing with off-the-shelf printer modifications is shown to achieve a minimum channel cross-section of 100×100 μm. The paper also lays out a protocol for the rapid fabrication of low-cost microfluidic channel moulds from the thermoplastic 3D-printed scaffolds, allowing the manufacture of customisable microfluidic systems without specialist equipment. The morphology of the resulting PDMS microchannels fabricated with the method are characterised and, when applied directly to glass, without plasma surface treatment, are shown to efficiently operate within the typical working pressures of commercial microfluidic devices. The technique is further validated through the demonstration of 2 common microfluidic devices; a fluid-mixer demonstrating the effective interconnecting scaffold design, and a microsphere droplet generator. The minimal cost of manufacture means that a 5000-piece physical library of mix-and-match channel scaffolds (100 μm scale) can be printed for ~$0.50 and made available to researchers and educators who lack access to appropriate technology. This simple yet innovative approach dramatically lowers the threshold for research and education into microfluidics and will make possible the rapid prototyping of point-of-care lab-on-a-chip diagnostic technology that is truly affordable the world over.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Felton","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Diaz-Gaxiola","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"felton2021","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0245206","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,3]]},"language":"en","page":"e0245206","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Negligible-cost microfluidic device fabrication using 3D-printed interconnecting channel scaffolds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245206","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"ferguson2022","abstract":"Tumor cell–derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are being explored as circulating biomarkers, but it is unclear whether bulk measurements will allow early cancer detection. We hypothesized that a single-EV analysis (sEVA) technique could potentially improve diagnostic accuracy. Using pancreatic cancer (PDAC), we analyzed the composition of putative cancer markers in 11 model lines. In parental PDAC cells positive for KRASmut and/or P53mut proteins, only ~40% of EVs were also positive. In a blinded study involving 16 patients with surgically proven stage 1 PDAC, KRASmut and P53mut protein was detectable at much lower levels, generally in <0.1% of vesicles.

Here, we show a sensor that combines the eﬃciency of light line illumination with the advantages of ﬂuidic conﬁnement. Tracking of freely diﬀusing nano-objects inside water-ﬁlled hollow core ﬁbers with core diameters of tens of micrometers using elastically scattered light from the core mode allows retrieving information about the Brownian motion and the size of each particle of the investigated ensemble individually using standard tracking algorithms and the mean squared displacement analysis. Speciﬁcally, we successfully measure the diameter of every gold nanosphere in an ensemble that consists of several hundreds of 40 nm particles, with an individual precision below 17% (±8 nm). In addition, we conﬁrm the relevance of our approach with respect to bioanalytics by analyzing 70 nm λ-phages. Overall these features, together with the strongly reduced demand for memory space, principally allows us to record thousands of frames and to achieve high frame rates for high precision tracking of nanoscale objects.","author":[{"family":"Fo","given":"Ronny"},{"family":"Chiang","given":"Timothy K"},{"family":"Garmann","given":"Rees F"},{"family":"Manoharan","given":"Vinothan N"},{"family":"Lahini","given":"Yoav"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Markus A"}],"citation-key":"fo2020","container-title":"ACS Sensors","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"8","source":"Zotero","title":"Tracking and Analyzing the Brownian Motion of Nano-objects Inside Hollow Core Fibers","type":"article-journal"},

Hydrogels are water-swollen networks formed from synthetic or naturally derived polymers and are emerging as important tools to address these challenges. Recent advances in hydrogel chemistries are enabling researchers to create hydrogels that can act as 3D ex vivo tissue models, allowing them to explore fundamental questions in cell biology by replicating tissues' dynamic and nonlinear physical properties. Enabled by cutting edge techniques such as 3D bioprinting, cell-laden hydrogels are also being developed with highly controlled tissue-specific architectures, vasculature, and biological functions that together can direct tissue repair. Moreover, advanced in situ forming and acellular hydrogels are increasingly finding use as delivery vehicles for bioactive compounds and in mediating host cell response. Here, advances in the design and fabrication of hydrogels for regenerative medicine are reviewed. It is also addressed how controlled chemistries are allowing for precise engineering of spatial and time-dependent properties in hydrogels with a look to how these materials will eventually translate to clinical applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Foyt","given":"Daniel A."},{"family":"Norman","given":"Michael D.

Limitations in the use of EVs origin from their inherent complexity and heterogeneity and from the sensitivity demand in detecting low to very low abundant disease-specific sub-populations. Such need can be met by digital detection, namely capable to reach the single-molecule sensitivity. Here we set to compare, side by side, two digital detection platforms that have recently gained increasing importance in the field of EVs. The platforms, both commercially available, are based on the principles of the Single Particle Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensing (SP-IRIS) and the Single Molecule Array technology (SiMoA) respectively. Sensitivity in immune-phenotyping of a well characterized EV sample is reported, discussing possible applicative implications and rationales for alternative or complementary use of the two platforms in biomarker discovery or validation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Frigerio","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Musicò","given":"Angelo"},{"family":"Strada","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Bergamaschi","given":"Greta"},{"family":"Panella","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Grange","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Marelli","given":"Marcello"},{"family":"Ferretti","given":"Anna M."},{"family":"Andriolo","given":"Gabriella"},{"family":"Bussolati","given":"Benedetta"},{"family":"Barile","given":"Lucio"},{"family":"Chiari","given":"Marcella"},{"family":"Gori","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Cretich","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"frigerio2022","container-title":"Journal of Extracellular Biology","DOI":"10.1002/jex2.53","ISSN":"2768-2811","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"e53","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Comparing digital detection platforms in high sensitivity immune-phenotyping of extracellular vesicles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jex2.53","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"fuhrmann2018","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently gained significant attention as important mediators of intercellular communication, potential drug carriers, and disease biomarkers. These natural cell-derived nanoparticles are postulated to be biocompatible, stable under physiological conditions, and to show reduced immunogenicity as compared to other synthetic nanoparticles. Although initial clinical trials are ongoing, the use of EVs for therapeutic applications may be limited due to undesired off-target activity and potential “dilution effects” upon systemic administration which may affect their ability to reach their target tissues. To fully exploit their therapeutic potential, EVs are embedded into implantable biomaterials designed to achieve local delivery of therapeutics taking advantage of enzyme prodrug therapy (EPT). In this first application of EVs for an EPT approach, EVs are used as smart carriers for stabilizing enzymes in a hydrogel for local controlled conversion of benign prodrugs to active antiinflammatory compounds. It is shown that the natural EVs' antiinflammatory potential is comparable or superior to synthetic carriers, in particular upon repeated long-term incubations and in different macrophage models of inflammation. Moreover, density-dependent color scanning electron microscopy imaging of EVs in a hydrogel is presented herein, an impactful tool for further understanding EVs in biological settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Fuhrmann","given":"Gregor"},{"family":"Chandrawati","given":"Rona"},{"family":"Parmar","given":"Paresh A."},{"family":"Keane","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Maynard","given":"Stephanie A."},{"family":"Bertazzo","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Molly M."}],"citation-key":"fuhrmann2018","container-title":"Advanced Materials","DOI":"10.1002/adma.201706616","ISSN":"1521-4095","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"1706616","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Engineering Extracellular Vesicles with the Tools of Enzyme Prodrug Therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201706616","volume":"30"},

Laboratory diagnosis of dengue is essential for providing appropriate supportive treatment to dengue patients with febrile illness, which is difficult to diagnose clinically. Here, we demonstrate surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based diagnosis of dengue virus in clinical blood samples collected from total of 102 subjects. All of the samples were well characterized by conventional NS1 antigen and IgM antibody ELISA kits. The silver nanorods array fabricated by glancing angle deposition technique were employed as SERS substrates. A small amount of patient blood serum (5 μL) was taken for analysis and the report was prepared within a minute. SERS spectra of pure NS1 protein as well as spiked in serum was also recorded separately. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed as the statistical tool to differentiate dengue positive, dengue negative, and healthy subjects on the basis of their respective SERS spectra.

  {"id":"gallup2001","abstract":"<section class=\"abstract\"><p>Malaria and poverty are intimately connected. Controlling for factors such as tropical location, colonial history, and geographical isolation, countries with intensive malaria had income levels in 1995 of only 33% that of countries without malaria, whether or not the countries were in Africa. The high levels of malaria in poor countries are not mainly a consequence of poverty. Malaria is geographically specific. The ecological conditions that support the more efficient malaria mosquito vectors primarily determine the distribution and intensity of the disease. Intensive efforts to eliminate malaria in the most severely affected tropical countries have been largely ineffective. Countries that have eliminated malaria in the past half century have all been either subtropical or islands. These countries' economic growth in the 5 years after eliminating malaria has usually been substantially higher than growth in the neighboring countries. Cross-country regressions for the 1965-1990 period confirm the relationship between malaria and economic growth. Taking into account initial poverty, economic policy, tropical location, and life expectancy, among other factors, countries with intensive malaria grew 1.3% less per person per year, and a 10% reduction in malaria was associated with 0.3% higher growth. Controlling for many other tropical diseases does not change the correlation of malaria with economic growth, and these diseases are not themselves significantly negatively correlated with economic growth. A second independent measure of malaria has a slightly higher correlation with economic growth in the 1980-1996 period. We speculate about the mechanisms that could cause malaria to have such a large impact on the economy, such as foreign investment and economic networks within the country.</p></section>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallup","given":"J.

  {"id":"gess-newsome1999","abstract":"ConclusionIt should be noted that the authors in this volume represent neither of the continuum extremes presented in the previous section. However, each author started with Shulman’s model and, based on their interpretation, shaped the model in unique ways that fit their perceptions of the data on teacher cognition. Hopefully this book will enhance the reader’s understanding of PCK through an analysis of both historic and current conceptions, an overview of the research literature, and a presentation of the practical implications derived from this model. Does the construct of PCK help or constrain our pursuit of excellence in teacher preparation? The answer to this question is left to the reader. An anticipated result of such contemplation will lead to individual and community exploration, development, and evaluation of alternative models used to study teacher cognition. As with PCK, future models will need to address the following questions: What knowledge do teachers need to possess in order to be effective? What model of teacher knowledge best explains the data that exists and stimulates future attempts to reconcile, synthesize, and expand our knowledge?Regardless of future evaluation, the explication of PCK as a construct and a model has reintroduced the importance of content knowledge into the teaching equation, promoted renewed vigor in the subject-specific teaching areas such as science education, and highlighted the need for integration of the various domains of knowledge in research, teaching, and teacher preparation. Using these criteria, PCK has proven to be an especially fruitful model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Gess-Newsome","given":"Julie"}],"citation-key":"gess-newsome1999","collection-title":"Science & Technology Education Library","container-title":"Examining Pedagogical Content Knowledge: The Construct and its Implications for Science Education","DOI":"10.1007/0-306-47217-1_1","editor":[{"family":"Gess-Newsome","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Lederman","given":"Norman G."}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-0-306-47217-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","page":"3-17","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"Pedagogical Content Knowledge: An Introduction and Orientation","title-short":"Pedagogical Content Knowledge","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/0-306-47217-1_1"},

To enable bio-integration, such microscopes need to be evaluated for their timeliness to answer biological questions uniquely and establish a long-term growth prospect.

Our study addresses this topic and considers to what degree technology transfer processes differ across different industrial sectors. To that end, we study to what extent technology transfer processes differ along both types of transfer mechanisms and key barriers inhibiting the transfer process. Based on a survey of Dutch practitioners on both sides of the transfer process, we test a number of hypotheses that differentiates between science-based regimes and development-based regimes. While our findings confirm our hypotheses concerning differences between the regimes regarding the use of specific transfer mechanisms, we also find that both regimes share a number of mechanisms that are similar. In addition, our findings show a remarkable degree of similarity among barriers inhibiting the process.

We rely on the fact that the diffusion coefficient of a molecule is determined by its size through the Stokes–Einstein relation, and achieve sensitivity to the diffusion coefficient by creating a concentration gradient and tracking its equilibration in an IR-frequency resolved manner. Analogous to NMR-DOSY, a two-dimensional IR-DOSY spectrum has IR frequency along one axis and diffusion coefficient (or equivalently, size) along the other, so the chemical structure and the size of a compound are characterized simultaneously. In an IR-DOSY spectrum of a mixture, molecules with different sizes are nicely separated into distinct sets of IR peaks. Extending this idea to higher dimensions, we also perform 3D-IR-DOSY, in which we combine the conformation sensitivity of femtosecond multi-dimensional IR spectroscopy with size sensitivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Giubertoni","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Rombouts","given":"Gijs"},{"family":"Caporaletti","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Deblais","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Diest","given":"Rianne","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Reek","given":"Joost N.

Electrochemistry at these nanostructurations can be imaged both operando and/or ex situ at the single nanoobject or nanoparticle (NP) level by diverse optical, electron, and local probe microscopy techniques. However, they only probe a tiny random fraction of interfaces that are by essence highly heterogeneous. Given the above background, correlative multimicroscopy strategy coupled to electrochemistry in a droplet cell provides a unique solution to gain mechanistic insights in electrocatalysis. To do so, a general machine-vision methodology is depicted enabling the automated local identification of various physical and chemical descriptors of NPs (size, composition, activity) obtained from multiple complementary operando and ex situ microscopy imaging of the electrode. These multifarious microscopically probed descriptors for each and all individual NPs are used to reconstruct the global electrochemical response.

Our experiments directly reveal the beating pattern in the fluorescent liquid resulting from the excitation of the first two linearly polarized hybrid modes in this system, being in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. The efficient excitation and beat of such modes in such an off-resonance situation distinguishes our device from regular directional mode couplers and can benefit applications that demand strong coupling between fundamental- and higher-order- modes, e.g. intermodal third-harmonic generation, bidirectional coupling, and nanofluidic sensing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Gomes","given":"André D."},{"family":"Gomes","given":"André D."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jiangbo Tim"},{"family":"Tuniz","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Tuniz","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Markus A."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Markus A."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Markus A."}],"citation-key":"gomes2021","container-title":"Optical Materials Express","container-title-short":"Opt.

  {"id":"gomez-de-mariscal2021","abstract":"Biomedical research has come to rely on p-values as a deterministic measure for data-driven decision-making. In the largely extended null hypothesis significance testing for identifying statistically significant differences among groups of observations, a single p-value is computed from sample data. Then, it is routinely compared with a threshold, commonly set to 0.05, to assess the evidence against the hypothesis of having non-significant differences among groups, or the null hypothesis. Because the estimated p-value tends to decrease when the sample size is increased, applying this methodology to datasets with large sample sizes results in the rejection of the null hypothesis, making it not meaningful in this specific situation. We propose a new approach to detect differences based on the dependence of the p-value on the sample size. We introduce new descriptive parameters that overcome the effect of the size in the p-value interpretation in the framework of datasets with large sample sizes, reducing the uncertainty in the decision about the existence of biological differences between the compared experiments. The methodology enables the graphical and quantitative characterization of the differences between the compared experiments guiding the researchers in the decision process.

  {"id":"gori","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs), crucial mediators of cell-to-cell communication, hold significant diagnostic potential due to their ability to concentrate protein biomarkers in bodily fluids. However, challenges in isolating EVs from biological specimens hinder their widespread use. The preferred strategy involves direct analysis, integrating isolation and analysis solutions, with immunoaffinity methods currently dominating. Yet, the heterogeneous nature of EVs poses challenges, as proposed markers may not be as universally present as thought, raising concerns about biomarker screening reliability. This issue extends to EV-mimics, where conventional methods may lack applicability. Addressing these challenges, the study reports on Membrane Sensing Peptides (MSP) as pan-vesicular affinity ligands for both EVs and their non-canonical analogs, streamlining capture and phenotyping through Single Molecule Array (SiMoA). MSP ligands enable direct analysis of circulating EVs, eliminating the need for prior isolation. Demonstrating clinical translation, MSP technology detects an EV-associated epitope signature in serum and plasma, distinguishing myocardial infarction from stable angina. Additionally, MSP allow analysis of tetraspanin-lacking Red Blood Cell-derived EVs, overcoming limitations associated with antibody-based methods. Overall, the work underlines the value of MSP as complementary tools to antibodies, advancing EV analysis for clinical diagnostics and beyond, and marking the first-ever peptide-based application in SiMoA technology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Gori","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Frigerio","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Gagni","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Burrello","given":"Jacopo"},{"family":"Panella","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Raimondi","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Bergamaschi","given":"Greta"},{"family":"Lodigiani","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Romano","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Zendrini","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Radeghieri","given":"Annalisa"},{"family":"Barile","given":"Lucio"},{"family":"Cretich","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"gori","container-title":"Advanced Science","DOI":"10.1002/advs.202400533","ISSN":"2198-3844","issue":"n/a","language":"en","license":"© 2024 The Authors.

  {"id":"gori2020","abstract":"Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) present fairly distinctive lipid membrane features in the extracellular environment. These include high curvature, lipid-packing defects and a relative abundance in lipids such as phosphatidylserine and ceramide. sEV membrane could be then considered as a “universal” marker, alternative or complementary to traditional, characteristic, surface-associated proteins. Here, we introduce the use of membrane-sensing peptides as new, highly efficient ligands to directly integrate sEV capturing and analysis on a microarray platform. Samples were analysed by label-free, single-particle counting and sizing, and by fluorescence co-localisation immune staining with fluorescent anti-CD9/anti-CD63/anti-CD81 antibodies. Peptides performed as selective yet general sEV baits and showed a binding capacity higher than anti-tetraspanins antibodies. Insights into surface chemistry for optimal peptide performances are also discussed, as capturing efficiency is strictly bound to probes surface orientation effects. We anticipate that this new class of ligands, also due to the versatility and limited costs of synthetic peptides, may greatly enrich the molecular toolbox for EV analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Gori","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Romanato","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Bergamaschi","given":"Greta"},{"family":"Strada","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Gagni","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Frigerio","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Brambilla","given":"Dario"},{"family":"Vago","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Galbiati","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Picciolini","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Bedoni","given":"Marzia"},{"family":"Daaboul","given":"George G."},{"family":"Chiari","given":"Marcella"},{"family":"Cretich","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"gori2020","container-title":"Journal of Extracellular Vesicles","DOI":"10.1080/20013078.2020.1751428","ISSN":"2001-3078","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"1751428","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Membrane-binding peptides for extracellular vesicles on-chip analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20013078.2020.1751428","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"goudsmit2021","abstract":"To identify potential extracellular vesicle (EV) biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we evaluated EV protein cargo and whole cell lysates (WCL) from HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC cell lines, as well as normal oral keratinocytes and HPV16-transformed cells. EVs were isolated from serum-depleted, conditioned cell culture media by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation/ultracentrifugation. EV and WCL preparations were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Candidate proteins detected at significantly higher levels in EV compared with WCL, or compared with EV from normal oral keratinocytes, were identified and confirmed by Wes Simple Western protein analysis. Our findings suggest that these proteins may be potential HNSCC EV markers as proteins that may be (1) selectively included in EV cargo for export from the cell as a strategy for metastasis, tumor cell survival, or modification of tumor microenvironment, or (2) representative of originating cell composition, which may be developed for diagnostic or prognostic use in clinical liquid biopsy applications. This work demonstrates that our method can be used to reliably detect EV proteins from HNSCC, normal keratinocyte, and transformed cell lines.

  {"id":"gui","abstract":"Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) represents one essential technology to characterize diffusing nanoscale objects. Herein, uncovering dynamic processes and high-precision measurements requires tracks with thousands of frames to reach high statistical significance, ideally at high frame rates. Optical fibers with nanochannels are used for NTA, successfully demonstrating acquisition of trajectories of fast diffusion nano-objects with 100 000 frames. Due to the spatial limitation of the central nanofluidic channel, diffusion of objects illuminated by the core mode is confined, enabling the recording of Brownian motion over extraordinarily long time scales at high frame rates. The resulting benefits are discussed on a representative track of a gold nanosphere diffusing in water in over nearly 100 000 frames at 2 kHz frame rate. In addition to the verification of the fiber-based NTA using two data processing methods, a segmented analysis reveals a correlation between precision of determined diameter and continuous time interval (i.e., number of frames per subtrajectory). The presented results demonstrate the capabilities of fiber-based NTA in terms of 1) determining diameters with extraordinary high precision of single species and 2) monitoring dynamic processes of the object or the fluidic environment, both of which are relevant within biology, microrheology, and nano-object characterization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Gui","given":"Fengji"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Shiqi"},{"family":"Förster","given":"Ronny"},{"family":"Plidschun","given":"Malte"},{"family":"Weidlich","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jiangbo"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Markus A."}],"citation-key":"gui","container-title":"Advanced Photonics Research","DOI":"10.1002/adpr.202100032","ISSN":"2699-9293","issue":"n/a","language":"en","page":"2100032","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Ultralong Tracking of Fast-Diffusing Nano-Objects inside Nanofluidic Channel−Enhanced Microstructured Optical Fiber","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adpr.202100032","volume":"n/a"},

  {"id":"guo2023","abstract":"Ultrafast 3D imaging is indispensable for visualizing complex and dynamic biological processes. Conventional scanning-based techniques necessitate an inherent tradeoff between the acquisition speed and space-bandwidth product (SBP). While single-shot 3D wide-field techniques have emerged as an attractive solution, they are still bottlenecked by the synchronous readout constraints of conventional CMOS architectures, thereby limiting the data throughput by frame rate to maintain a high SBP. Here, we present EventLFM, a straightforward and cost-effective system that circumnavigates these challenges by integrating an event camera with Fourier light field microscopy (LFM), a single-shot 3D wide-field imaging technique. The event camera operates on a novel asynchronous readout architecture, thereby bypassing the frame rate limitations intrinsic to conventional CMOS systems. We further develop a simple and robust event-driven LFM reconstruction algorithm that can reliably reconstruct 3D dynamics from the unique spatiotemporal measurements from EventLFM. We experimentally demonstrate that EventLFM can robustly image fast-moving and rapidly blinking 3D samples at KHz frame rates and furthermore, showcase EventLFM’s ability to achieve 3D tracking of GFP-labeled neurons in freely moving C. elegans. We believe that the combined ultrafast speed and large 3D SBP offered by EventLFM may open up new possibilities across many biomedical applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"Ruipeng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Qianwan"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Andrew S."},{"family":"Hu","given":"Guorong"},{"family":"Greene","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Gabel","given":"Christopher V."},{"family":"You","given":"Sixian"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Lei"}],"citation-key":"guo2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2310.00730","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"EventLFM: Event Camera integrated Fourier Light Field Microscopy for Ultrafast 3D imaging","title-short":"EventLFM","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00730"},

Because the axial positions of the single emitters are encoded in the shape of each single-molecule image rather than in the position or thickness of the light sheet, the light sheet need not be extremely thin.

Analysis of Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene burial practices throughout the Americas situate WMP6 as the earliest and most secure hunter burial in a sample that includes 10 other females in statistical parity with early male hunter burials.

Here we present genome-wide data from three individuals dated to between 45,930 and 42,580 years ago from Bacho Kiro Cave, Bulgaria1,2. They are the earliest Late Pleistocene modern humans known to have been recovered in Europe so far, and were found in association with an Initial Upper Palaeolithic artefact assemblage. Unlike two previously studied individuals of similar ages from Romania7 and Siberia8 who did not contribute detectably to later populations, these individuals are more closely related to present-day and ancient populations in East Asia and the Americas than to later west Eurasian populations. This indicates that they belonged to a modern human migration into Europe that was not previously known from the genetic record, and provides evidence that there was at least some continuity between the earliest modern humans in Europe and later people in Eurasia. Moreover, we find that all three individuals had Neanderthal ancestors a few generations back in their family history, confirming that the first European modern humans mixed with Neanderthals and suggesting that such mixing could have been common.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hajdinjak","given":"Mateja"},{"family":"Mafessoni","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Skov","given":"Laurits"},{"family":"Vernot","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Hübner","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Qiaomei"},{"family":"Essel","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Nagel","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Nickel","given":"Birgit"},{"family":"Richter","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Moldovan","given":"Oana Teodora"},{"family":"Constantin","given":"Silviu"},{"family":"Endarova","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Zahariev","given":"Nikolay"},{"family":"Spasov","given":"Rosen"},{"family":"Welker","given":"Frido"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Geoff M."},{"family":"Sinet-Mathiot","given":"Virginie"},{"family":"Paskulin","given":"Lindsey"},{"family":"Fewlass","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Talamo","given":"Sahra"},{"family":"Rezek","given":"Zeljko"},{"family":"Sirakova","given":"Svoboda"},{"family":"Sirakov","given":"Nikolay"},{"family":"McPherron","given":"Shannon P."},{"family":"Tsanova","given":"Tsenka"},{"family":"Hublin","given":"Jean-Jacques"},{"family":"Peter","given":"Benjamin M."},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Skoglund","given":"Pontus"},{"family":"Kelso","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Pääbo","given":"Svante"}],"citation-key":"hajdinjak2021","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03335-3","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7853","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s)","number":"7853","page":"253-257","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Initial Upper Palaeolithic humans in Europe had recent Neanderthal ancestry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03335-3","volume":"592"},

Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named “inclusive fitness”. Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships.

  {"id":"han2023","abstract":"Lipid nanoparticle-mediated RNA delivery holds great potential to treat various liver diseases. However, targeted delivery of RNA therapeutics to activated liver-resident fibroblasts for liver fibrosis treatment remains challenging. Here, we develop a combinatorial library of anisamide ligand-tethered lipidoids (AA-lipidoids) using a one-pot, two-step modular synthetic method and adopt a two-round screening strategy to identify AA-lipidoids with both high potency and selectivity to deliver RNA payloads to activated fibroblasts. The lead AA-lipidoid AA-T3A-C12 mediates greater RNA delivery and transfection of activated fibroblasts than its analog without anisamide and the FDA-approved MC3 ionizable lipid. In a preclinical model of liver fibrosis, AA-T3A-C12 enables ~65% silencing of heat shock protein 47, a therapeutic target primarily expressed by activated fibroblasts, which is 2-fold more potent than MC3, leading to significantly reduced collagen deposition and liver fibrosis. These results demonstrate the potential of AA-lipidoids for targeted RNA delivery to activated fibroblasts. Furthermore, these synthetic methods and screening strategies open a new avenue to develop and discover potent lipidoids with targeting properties, which can potentially enable RNA delivery to a range of cell and tissue types that are challenging to access using traditional lipid nanoparticle formulations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Xuexiang"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Ningqiang"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Lulu"},{"family":"Billingsley","given":"Margaret M."},{"family":"El-Mayta","given":"Rakan"},{"family":"Shepherd","given":"Sarah J."},{"family":"Alameh","given":"Mohamad-Gabriel"},{"family":"Weissman","given":"Drew"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"han2023","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-022-35637-z","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,17]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"75","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Ligand-tethered lipid nanoparticles for targeted RNA delivery to treat liver fibrosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35637-z","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"hawkins2023","abstract":"For more than 400 million years, mycorrhizal fungi and plants have formed partnerships that are crucial to the emergence and functioning of global ecosystems. The importance of these symbiotic fungi for plant nutrition is well established. However, the role of mycorrhizal fungi in transporting carbon into soil systems on a global scale remains under-explored. This is surprising given that ∼75% of terrestrial carbon is stored belowground and mycorrhizal fungi are stationed at a key entry point of carbon into soil food webs. Here, we analyze nearly 200 datasets to provide the first global quantitative estimates of carbon allocation from plants to the mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi. We estimate that global plant communities allocate 3.93 Gt CO2e per year to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, 9.07 Gt CO2e per year to ectomycorrhizal fungi, and 0.12 Gt CO2e per year to ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. Based on this estimate, 13.12 Gt of CO2e fixed by terrestrial plants is, at least temporarily, allocated to the underground mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi per year, equating to ∼36% of current annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. We explore the mechanisms by which mycorrhizal fungi affect soil carbon pools and identify approaches to increase our understanding of global carbon fluxes via plant–fungal pathways. Our estimates, although based on the best available evidence, are imperfect and should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, our estimations are conservative, and we argue that this work confirms the significant contribution made by mycorrhizal associations to global carbon dynamics. Our findings should motivate their inclusion both within global climate and carbon cycling models, and within conservation policy and practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hawkins","given":"Heidi-Jayne"},{"family":"Cargill","given":"Rachael I.

This paper extends our understanding of why and how individuals who define themselves as a scientist develop or fail to develop a new commercialization-focused entrepreneurial identity. We develop an explanatory process model by drawing from the concept of liminality, a transitional state during which individuals construct or reconstruct an identity, as well as the entrepreneurship literature. The model not only provides a stylized illustration of identity development and its associated behavioral outcomes, but it also includes several factors such as agency and passion, liminal competence, social support, organizational and institutional support, and temporal factors that moderate the process. We contribute to the literature on entrepreneurial identity by providing a dynamic conceptualization of identity construction and incorporation, among other outcomes, as well as to the academic entrepreneurship literature by elucidating the origin and development of entrepreneurial identities among scientists. A conceptual focus on identity-related micro-processes may help explain why some scientists are more successful at commercializing technologies derived from their research than others.

Here, by introducing a new interferometric scattering (iSCAT) image processing and analysis strategy adapted to diffusing particles, we enable mass-sensitive particle tracking (MSPT) of single unlabeled biomolecules on a supported lipid bilayer. We applied this approach to the highly nonlinear reaction cycles underlying MinDE protein self-organization. MSPT allowed us to determine the stoichiometry and turnover of individual membrane-bound MinD/MinDE protein complexes and to quantify their size-dependent diffusion.

They are now central to research in many fields of biology because they seem to constitute a new system of cell–cell communication. Physical and chemical characteristics of many EVs, as well as their biogenesis pathways, resemble those of retroviruses. Moreover, EVs generated by virus-infected cells can incorporate viral proteins and fragments of viral RNA, being thus indistinguishable from defective (noninfectious) retroviruses. EVs, depending on the proteins and genetic material incorporated in them, play a significant role in viral infection, both facilitating and suppressing it. Deciphering the mechanisms of EV-cell interactions may facilitate the design of EVs that inhibit viral infection and can be used as vehicles for targeted drug delivery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoen","given":"Esther Nolte-‘t"},{"family":"Cremer","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Gallo","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"Margolis","given":"Leonid B."}],"citation-key":"hoen2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1605146113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"33","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,16]]},"language":"en","license":"©  .

  {"id":"hofer2024","abstract":"Children from lower socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds tend to have more negative self-perceptions. More negative self-perceptions are often related to lower academic achievement. Linking these findings, we asked: Do children’s self-perceptions help explain socioeconomic disparities in academic achievement around the world? We addressed this question using data from the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) survey, including n = 520,729 records of 15-year-old students from 70 countries. We studied five self-perceptions (self-perceived competency, self-efficacy, growth mindset, sense of belonging, and fear of failure) and assessed academic achievement in terms of reading achievement. As predicted, across countries, children’s self-perceptions jointly and separately partially mediated the association between socioeconomic status and reading achievement, explaining additional 11% (ΔR2 = 0.105) of the variance in reading achievement. The positive mediation effect of self-perceived competency was more pronounced in countries with higher social mobility, indicating the importance of environments that “afford” the use of beneficial self-perceptions. While the results tentatively suggest self-perceptions, in general, to be an important lever to address inequality, interventions targeting self-perceived competency might be particularly effective in counteracting educational inequalities in countries with higher social mobility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofer","given":"Sarah I."},{"family":"Heine","given":"Jörg-Henrik"},{"family":"Besharati","given":"Sahba"},{"family":"Yip","given":"Jason C."},{"family":"Reinhold","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Brummelman","given":"Eddie"}],"citation-key":"hofer2024","container-title":"npj Science of Learning","container-title-short":"npj Sci.

Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well? We study this by utilizing a near-population of ~1.2 million US doctoral recipients from 1977-2015 and following their careers into publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: e.g., novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity’s role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofstra","given":"Bas"},{"family":"Kulkarni","given":"Vivek V."},{"family":"Munoz-Najar Galvez","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"He","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"},{"family":"McFarland","given":"Daniel A."}],"citation-key":"hofstra2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1915378117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,28]]},"language":"en","page":"9284-9291","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Diversity–Innovation Paradox in Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915378117","volume":"117"},

Here we demonstrate that exosomes from mouse and human lung-, liver- and brain-tropic tumour cells fuse preferentially with resident cells at their predicted destination, namely lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells, liver Kupffer cells and brain endothelial cells. We show that tumour-derived exosomes uptaken by organ-specific cells prepare the pre-metastatic niche. Treatment with exosomes from lung-tropic models redirected the metastasis of bone-tropic tumour cells. Exosome proteomics revealed distinct integrin expression patterns, in which the exosomal integrins α6β4 and α6β1 were associated with lung metastasis, while exosomal integrin αvβ5 was linked to liver metastasis. Targeting the integrins α6β4 and αvβ5 decreased exosome uptake, as well as lung and liver metastasis, respectively. We demonstrate that exosome integrin uptake by resident cells activates Src phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory S100 gene expression. Finally, our clinical data indicate that exosomal integrins could be used to predict organ-specific metastasis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoshino","given":"Ayuko"},{"family":"Costa-Silva","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Tang-Long"},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"Goncalo"},{"family":"Hashimoto","given":"Ayako"},{"family":"Tesic Mark","given":"Milica"},{"family":"Molina","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Kohsaka","given":"Shinji"},{"family":"Di Giannatale","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Ceder","given":"Sophia"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Swarnima"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Caitlin"},{"family":"Soplop","given":"Nadine"},{"family":"Uryu","given":"Kunihiro"},{"family":"Pharmer","given":"Lindsay"},{"family":"King","given":"Tari"},{"family":"Bojmar","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Alexander E."},{"family":"Ararso","given":"Yonathan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tuo"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Haiying"},{"family":"Hernandez","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Joshua M."},{"family":"Dumont-Cole","given":"Vanessa D."},{"family":"Kramer","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Wexler","given":"Leonard H."},{"family":"Narendran","given":"Aru"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Gary K."},{"family":"Healey","given":"John H."},{"family":"Sandstrom","given":"Per"},{"family":"Jørgen Labori","given":"Knut"},{"family":"Kure","given":"Elin H."},{"family":"Grandgenett","given":"Paul M."},{"family":"Hollingsworth","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Sousa","given":"Maria","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Kaur","given":"Sukhwinder"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Maneesh"},{"family":"Mallya","given":"Kavita"},{"family":"Batra","given":"Surinder K."},{"family":"Jarnagin","given":"William R."},{"family":"Brady","given":"Mary S."},{"family":"Fodstad","given":"Oystein"},{"family":"Muller","given":"Volkmar"},{"family":"Pantel","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Minn","given":"Andy J."},{"family":"Bissell","given":"Mina J."},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Kang","given":"Yibin"},{"family":"Rajasekhar","given":"Vinagolu K."},{"family":"Ghajar","given":"Cyrus M."},{"family":"Matei","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Peinado","given":"Hector"},{"family":"Bromberg","given":"Jacqueline"},{"family":"Lyden","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"hoshino2015","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature15756","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7578","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11]]},"language":"en","license":"2015 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  {"id":"hotte2019","abstract":"In three-dimensional light microscopy, the heterogeneity of the optical density in a specimen ultimately limits the achievable penetration depth and hence the three-dimensional resolution. The most direct approach to reduce aberrations, improve the contrast and achieve an optimal resolution is to minimise the impact of changes of the refractive index along an optical path. Many implementations of light sheet fluorescence microscopy operate with a large chamber filled with an aqueous immersion medium and a further inner container with the specimen embedded in a possibly entirely different non-aqueous medium. In order to minimise the impact of the latter on the optical quality of the images, we use multi-facetted cuvettes fabricated from vacuum-formed ultra-thin fluorocarbon (FEP) foils. The ultra-thin FEP-foil cuvettes have a wall thickness of about 10–12 µm. They are impermeable to liquids, but not to gases, inert, durable, mechanically stable and flexible. Importantly, the usually fragile specimen can remain in the same cuvette from seeding to fixation, clearing and observation, without the need to remove or remount it during any of these steps. We confirm the improved imaging performance of ultra-thin FEP-foil cuvettes with excellent quality images of whole organs such us mouse oocytes, of thick tissue sections from mouse brain and kidney as well as of dense pancreas and liver organoid clusters. Our ultra-thin FEP-foil cuvettes outperform many other sample-mounting techniques in terms of a full separation of the specimen from the immersion medium, compatibility with aqueous and organic clearing media, quick specimen mounting without hydrogel embedding and their applicability for multiple-view imaging and automated image segmentation. Additionally, we show that ultra-thin FEP foil cuvettes are suitable for seeding and growing organoids over a time period of at least ten days. The new cuvettes allow the fixation and staining of specimens inside the holder, preserving the delicate morphology of e.g. fragile, mono-layered three-dimensional organoids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hötte","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Koch","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Hof","given":"Lotta"},{"family":"Tuppi","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Moreth","given":"Till"},{"family":"Verstegen","given":"Monique M.

  {"id":"housmans2023","abstract":"Disrupted protein folding or decreased protein stability can lead to the accumulation of (partially) un- or misfolded proteins, which ultimately cause the formation of protein aggregates. Much of the interest in protein aggregation is associated with its involvement in a wide range of human diseases and the challenges it poses for large-scale biopharmaceutical manufacturing and formulation of therapeutic proteins and peptides. On the other hand, protein aggregates can also be functional, as observed in nature, which triggered its use in the development of biomaterials or therapeutics as well as for the improvement of food characteristics. Thus, unmasking the various steps involved in protein aggregation is critical to obtain a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of amyloid formation.

The idea for a target can come from a variety of sources including academic and clinical research and from the commercial sector. It may take many years to build up a body of supporting evidence before selecting a target for a costly drug discovery programme. Once a target has been chosen, the pharmaceutical industry and more recently some academic centres have streamlined a number of early processes to identify molecules which possess suitable characteristics to make acceptable drugs. This review will look at key preclinical stages of the drug discovery process, from initial target identification and validation, through assay development, high throughput screening, hit identification, lead optimization and finally the selection of a candidate molecule for clinical development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"Jp"},{"family":"Rees","given":"S"},{"family":"Kalindjian","given":"Sb"},{"family":"Philpott","given":"Kl"}],"citation-key":"hughes2011","container-title":"British Journal of Pharmacology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.01127.x","ISSN":"1476-5381","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"1239-1249","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Principles of early drug discovery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.01127.x","volume":"162"},

Here, using in vitro infection models, we show that hypothalamic NSCs (htNSCs) Ex/Mv provided an innate immunity protection against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, enhanced antiviral actions were achieved by using induced Ex/Mv that were derived from induced htNSCs through twice being exposed to several RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 genome, a process that was designed not to involve protein translation of these RNA fragments. The increased antiviral effects of these induced Ex/Mv were associated with increased expression of piRNA species some of which could predictably target SARS-CoV-2 genome. Knockout of piRNA-interacting protein PIWIL2 in htNSCs led to reductions in both innate and induced antiviral effects of Ex/Mv in targeting SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, this study demonstrates a case suggesting Ex/Mv from certain cell types have innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and the PIWI-piRNA system is important for these antiviral actions.","author":[{"family":"Ikhlas","given":"Shoeb"},{"literal":"Afia Usman"},{"literal":"Dongkyeong Kim"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Dongsheng"}],"citation-key":"ikhlas2022","DOI":"10.26508/lsa.202101240","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3216799489","PMID":"34862272","title":"Exosomes/microvesicles target SARS-CoV-2 via innate and RNA-induced immunity with PIWI-piRNA system.","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"ingaramo2015","abstract":"We describe two-step fluorescence microscopy, a new approach to non-linear imaging based on positive reversible photoswitchable fluorescent probes. The protein Padron approximates ideal two-step fluorescent behaviour: it equilibrates to an inactive state, converts to an active state under blue light, and blue light also excites this active state to fluoresce. Both activation and excitation are linear processes, but the total fluorescent signal is quadratic, proportional to the square of the illumination dose. Here, we use Padron’s quadratic non-linearity to demonstrate the principle of two-step microscopy, similar in principle to two-photon microscopy but with orders-of-magnitude better cross-section. As with two-photon, quadratic non-linearity from two-step fluorescence improves resolution and reduces unwanted out-of-focus excitation, and is compatible with structured illumination microscopy. We also show two-step and two-photon imaging can be combined to give quartic non-linearity, further improving imaging in challenging samples. With further improvements, two-step fluorophores could replace conventional fluorophores for many imaging applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ingaramo","given":"Maria"},{"family":"York","given":"Andrew G."},{"family":"Andrade","given":"Eric J."},{"family":"Rainey","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"George H."}],"citation-key":"ingaramo2015","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms9184","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,3]]},"language":"en","license":"2015 The Author(s)","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Microscopy\nSubject_term_id: microscopy","number":"1","page":"8184","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Two-photon-like microscopy with orders-of-magnitude lower illumination intensity via two-step fluorescence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9184","volume":"6"},

However, traditional evaluation methods rely on simple regression and assumption models, which are easy to lead to unreliable evaluation results. The time-consuming and complex calculations in corrosion assessment are particularly suitable for machine learning (ML) and have already been deeply affected by the application of existing ML algorithms. The review analyzes recent ML methods for corrosion assessment of RC structures. These algorithms have recently had a significant impact on the estimation of the corrosion process, significant mechanical properties and durability of RC structures. In addition, some challenges that have emerged in corrosion evaluation and could be solved by ML algorithm are discussed critically. Through the detailed analysis of the challenges and future directions, researchers and engineers related industry will gain vital insight on the sustainable durability design of RC structures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Jia","given":"Hanxi"},{"family":"Qiao","given":"Guofu"},{"family":"Han","given":"Peng"}],"citation-key":"jia2022","container-title":"Cement and Concrete Composites","container-title-short":"Cement and Concrete Composites","DOI":"10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2022.104725","ISSN":"0958-9465","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,1]]},"page":"104725","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Machine learning algorithms in the environmental corrosion evaluation of reinforced concrete structures - A review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958946522003183","volume":"133"},

  {"id":"jin2018","abstract":"In operando and nondestructive technology is urgently needed to monitor and further control lithium metal morphology evolution for reviving lithium metal batteries. Taking advantage of lithium plasmonics, we developed an in operando plasmonic monitoring platform to investigate lithium deposition behavior in different working conditions and varied electrolytes. This technology, with a well-established correlation between the evolving morphologies of lithium metal and in operando optical spectra, can serve as an effective platform for investigating lithium morphology during electrochemical operations, which can further speed up new electrolyte design and the development of alkali metal-based energy storage systems., The recent renaissance of lithium metal batteries as promising energy storage devices calls for in operando monitoring and control of electrochemical evolution of lithium metal morphologies. While the development of plasmonics has led to significant advancement in real-time and ultrasensitive chemical and biological sensing and surface-enhanced spectroscopies, alkali metals featured by ideal free electron gas models have long been regarded as promising plasmonic materials but seldom been explored due to their high chemical reactivity. Here, we demonstrate the in operando plasmonic monitoring of the electrochemical evolution of lithium metal during battery cycling by taking advantage of selective electrochemical deposition. The relationships between the evolving morphologies of lithium metal and in operando optical spectra are established both numerically and experimentally: Ordered growth of lithium particles shows clear size-dependent reflective dips due to hybrid surface plasmon resonances, while the formation of undesirable disordered lithium dendrites exhibits a flat spectroscopic profile with pure suppression in reflection intensity. Under the in operando plasmonic monitoring enabled by the microscopic morphology of metal, the differences of lithium evolutionary behaviors with different electrolytes can be conveniently identified without destruction. At the intersection of energy storage and plasmonics, it is expected that the ability to actively control and in operando plasmonically monitor electrochemical evolution of lithium metal can provide a promising platform for investigating lithium metal behavior during electrochemical cycling under various working conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Jin","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Jianyu"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Wenshan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Huigang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Shining"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jia"}],"citation-key":"jin2018","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1808600115","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"44","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,30]]},"page":"11168-11173","PMCID":"PMC6217408","PMID":"30322934","source":"PubMed Central","title":"In operando plasmonic monitoring of electrochemical evolution of lithium metal","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6217408/","volume":"115"},
  {"id":"jin2021","abstract":"On-chip imaging flow cytometry has been widely used in cancer biology, immunology, microbiology, and drug discovery. Pure optical imaging combined with flow cytometry to derive chemical, structural, and morphological features of cells provides systematic insights into biological processes. However, due to the high concentration and strong optical attenuation of red blood cells, preprocessing is necessary for optical flow cytometry while dealing with whole blood. In this study, we develop an on-chip photoacoustic imaging flow cytometry (PAIFC), which combines multicolor high-speed photoacoustic microscopy and microfluidics for cell imaging. The device employs a micro-optical scanner to achieve a miniaturized outer size of 30 × 17 × 24 mm3 and ultrafast cross-sectional imaging at a frame rate of 1758 Hz and provides lateral and axial resolutions of 2.2 and 33 μm, respectively. Using a multicolor strategy, PAIFC is able to differentiate cells labeled by external contrast agents, detect melanoma cells with an endogenous contrast in whole blood, and image melanoma cells in blood samples from tumor-bearing mice. The results suggest that PAIFC has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for future cell-on-chip applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Jin","given":"Tian"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xingxing"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Guangru"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Suzi"},{"family":"Song","given":"Chaolong"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Jianbing"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Weibao"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xingyu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Xi","given":"Lei"}],"citation-key":"jin2021","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

  {"id":"juillot2021","abstract":"<p>How cells control their shape and size is a fundamental question of biology. In most bacteria, cell shape is imposed by the peptidoglycan (PG) polymeric meshwork that surrounds the cell. Thus, bacterial cell morphogenesis results from the coordinated action of the proteins assembling and degrading the PG shell. Remarkably, during steady-state growth, most bacteria maintain a defined shape along generations, suggesting that error-proof mechanisms tightly control the process. In the rod-shaped model for Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis, the average cell length varies as a function of the growth rate but the cell diameter remains constant throughout the cell cycle and across growth conditions. Here, in an attempt to shed light on the cellular circuits controlling bacterial cell width, we developed a screen to identify genetic determinants of cell width in B. subtilis. Using high-content screening (HCS) fluorescence microscopy and semi-automated measurement of single-cell dimensions, we screened a library of ~ 4000 single knockout mutants. We identified 13 mutations significantly altering cell diameter, in genes that belong to several functional groups.

Accurate sizing and quantification of EVs remain problematic, given their nanometer size range and small scattering cross-sections. This is compounded by the fact that common EV isolation methods result in co-isolation of particles with comparable features. Especially in blood plasma, similarly-sized lipoproteins outnumber EVs to a great extent. Recently, interferometric nanoparticle tracking analysis (iNTA) was introduced as a particle analysis method that enables determining the size and refractive index of nanoparticles with high sensitivity and precision. In this work, we apply iNTA to differentiate between EVs and lipoproteins, and compare its performance to conventional nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). We show that iNTA can accurately quantify EVs in artificial EV-lipoprotein mixtures and in plasma-derived EV samples of varying complexity.

In the context of inertial sensing, which can measure mass with atomic precision, rotational dynamics are normally considered a complication hindering measurement interpretation. Here, we exploit the rotational dynamics of a microfluidic device to develop a modality in inertial sensing. Combining theory with experiments, we show that this modality measures the volume of a rigid particle while normally being insensitive to its density. Paradoxically, particle density only emerges when fluid viscosity becomes dominant over inertia. We explain this paradox via a viscosity-driven, hydrodynamic coupling between the fluid and the particle that activates the rotational inertia of the particle, converting it into a ‘viscous flywheel’.

  {"id":"khazan2019","abstract":"Bias in teaching evaluations has been documented across academia. Women and people from non-white minority groups receive lower ratings from students when compared to white males. Student evaluations of teaching (SET) play an important role in assessing instructors' teaching quality, and thus impact hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions. Similarly, student ratings of teaching assistants (TA) can impact future career opportunities. We investigated gender bias in student evaluations of TAs. Students in a large, asynchronous, online course were deceptively assigned to either a putative male or putative female TA. In reality, one female TA performed all TA duties, grading assignments and communicating with students under the guise of each student's assigned TA. Overall, evaluations were positive, however, evaluations of the putative male and female TAs demonstrated inconsistency across student gender. Female students demonstrated the greatest variation; 100% of females assigned to the \"male\" TA rated the TA positively, whereas 88% of female students assigned to the \"female\" TA gave positive ratings. This study corroborates literature demonstrating bias against women in SET. The lack of strong statistical trends in our study could indicate a shift in student perspective or demonstrate that gender bias is muted in the asynchronous online learning environment.","author":[{"family":"Khazan","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"S"},{"family":"Greenhaw","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Borden","given":"Jesse"}],"citation-key":"khazan2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Examining Gender Bias in Student Evaluations of Teaching for Graduate Teaching Assistants","type":"book"},

  {"id":"kim2021","abstract":"Oxidative stress is implicated in many diseases, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Because an increased level of oxidative stress causes apoptosis, it is necessary to inhibit cellular responses to oxidative stress. In this study, Carex, a nanovesicle from carrot, was isolated and investigated as a novel biomaterial with antioxidative function in cardiomyoblasts and neuroblastoma cells. A high concentration of nanovesicles was purified from carrots, using size-exclusion chromatography in combination with ultrafiltration. The characterization of Carex demonstrated that it had properties similar to those of extracellular vesicles. Carex showed low cytotoxicity in both H9C2 cardiomyoblasts and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, when a high level of Carex was delivered to the cells. Carex was further investigated for its antioxidative and apoptotic effects, and it significantly inhibited ROS generation and apoptosis in vitro in myocardial infarction and Parkinson’s disease models. Carex inhibited the reduction of antioxidative molecule expression, including Nrf-2, HO-1, and NQO-1, in both models. Considering its antioxidative function and high production yield, Carex is a potential drug candidate for the treatment of myocardial infarction as well as Parkinson’s disease. Thus, the results demonstrated in this study will contribute to an exploration of a novel drug, using nanovesicles from plants, including carrots.","author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Kyung"},{"family":"Rhee","given":"Won Jong"},{"literal":"Won Jong Rhee"}],"citation-key":"kim2021","container-title":"Pharmaceutics","DOI":"10.3390/pharmaceutics13081203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,5]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3190875509","page":"1203","title":"Antioxidative Effects of Carrot-Derived Nanovesicles in Cardiomyoblast and Neuroblastoma Cells.","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"kluge2022","abstract":"To date, no reliable clinically applicable biomarker has been established for Parkinson’s disease. Our results indicate that a long anticipated blood test for Parkinson’s disease may be realized. Following the isolation of neuron-derived extracellular vesicles of Parkinson’s disease patients and non-Parkinson’s disease individuals, immunoblot analyses were performed to detect extracellular vesicle-derived α-synuclein. Pathological α-synuclein forms derived from neuronal extracellular vesicles could be detected under native conditions and were significantly increased in all individuals with Parkinson’s disease and clearly distinguished disease from the non-disease state. By performing an α-synuclein seeding assay these soluble conformers could be amplified and seeding of pathological protein folding was demonstrated. Amplified α-synuclein conformers exhibited β-sheet-rich structures and a fibrillary appearance. Our study demonstrates that the detection of pathological α-synuclein conformers from neuron-derived extracellular vesicles from blood plasma samples has the potential to evolve into a blood-biomarker of Parkinson’s disease that is still lacking so far. Moreover, the distribution of seeding-competent α-synuclein within blood exosomes sheds a new light of pathological disease mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kluge","given":"Annika"},{"family":"Bunk","given":"Josina"},{"family":"Schaeffer","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Drobny","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Xiang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Knacke","given":"Henrike"},{"family":"Bub","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Lückstädt","given":"Wiebke"},{"family":"Arnold","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Lucius","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Berg","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Zunke","given":"Friederike"}],"citation-key":"kluge2022","container-title":"Brain","container-title-short":"Brain","DOI":"10.1093/brain/awac115","ISSN":"0006-8950","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,20]]},"page":"awac115","source":"Silverchair","title":"Detection of neuron-derived pathological α-synuclein in blood","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awac115"},

  {"id":"kohlheyer2008","abstract":"Free-flow electrophoresis (FFE) separation methods have been developed and investigated for around 50 years and have been applied not only to many types of analytes for various biomedical applications, but also for the separation of inorganic and organic substances. Its continuous sample preparation and mild separation conditions make it also interesting for online monitoring and detection applications. Since 1994 several microfluidic, miniaturized FFE devices were developed and experimentally characterized. In contrast to their large-scale counterparts microfluidic FFE (μ-FFE) devices offer new possibilities due to the very rapid separations within several seconds or below and the requirement for sample volumes in the microliter range. Eventually, these μ-FFE systems might find application in so-called lab-on-a-chip devices for real-time monitoring and separation applications. This review gives detailed information on the results so far published on μ-FFE chips, comprising its four main modes, namely free-flow zone electrophoresis (FFZE), free-flow IEF (FFIEF), free-flow ITP (FFITP), and free-flow field-step electrophoresis (FFFSE). The principles of the different FFE modes and the basic underlying theory are given and discussed with special emphasis on miniaturization. Different designs as well as fabrication methods and applied materials are discussed and evaluated. Furthermore, the separation results shown indicate that similar separation quality with respect to conventional FFE systems, as defined by the resolution and peak capacity, can be achieved with μ-FFE separations when applying much lower electrical voltages. Furthermore, innovations still occur and several approaches for hyphenated, more integrated systems have been proposed so far, some of which are discussed here. This review is intended as an introduction and early compendium for research and development within this field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kohlheyer","given":"Dietrich"},{"family":"Eijkel","given":"Jan C.

However, epistemology of experiments is not often addressed directly in the educational and pedagogical literature. This warrants an attempt to produce an acceptable reconstruction of the epistemological role of experiments in physics by drawing insight from history and philosophy of physics. Towards that end, the experiments’ role in the 19th-century physics is discussed. We propose here a reconstruction, which is based on the idea that in epistemology of experiments the inductive-like generative justification of knowledge is central. A generative view makes it possible to retain those aspects of experiments which make them purposeful for learning and can give a starting point for students’ own construction of knowledge. The reconstruction also helps to conceive the experiments with their correct historical role and helps to bring back the generative use of experiments in teaching, which, after all, has never vanished from the practice of physics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Koponen","given":"Ismo T."},{"family":"Mäntylä","given":"Terhi"}],"citation-key":"koponen2006","container-title":"Science & Education","container-title-short":"Sci Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s11191-005-3199-6","ISSN":"1573-1901","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"31-54","source":"Springer Link","title":"Generative Role of Experiments in Physics and in Teaching Physics: A Suggestion for Epistemological Reconstruction","title-short":"Generative Role of Experiments in Physics and in Teaching Physics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-005-3199-6","volume":"15"},

Cells release heterogeneous vesicles of different sizes and intracellular origins, including small EVs formed inside endosomal compartments (i.e., exosomes) and EVs of various sizes budding from the plasma membrane. Specific markers for the analysis and isolation of different EV populations are missing, imposing important limitations to understanding EV functions. Here, EVs from human dendritic cells were first separated by their sedimentation speed, and then either by their behavior upon upward floatation into iodixanol gradients or by immuno-isolation. Extensive quantitative proteomic analysis allowing comparison of the isolated populations showed that several classically used exosome markers, like major histocompatibility complex, flotillin, and heat-shock 70-kDa proteins, are similarly present in all EVs. We identified proteins specifically enriched in small EVs, and define a set of five protein categories displaying different relative abundance in distinct EV populations. We demonstrate the presence of exosomal and nonexosomal subpopulations within small EVs, and propose their differential separation by immuno-isolation using either CD63, CD81, or CD9. Our work thus provides guidelines to define subtypes of EVs for future functional studies.","author":[{"family":"Kowal","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Arras","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Colombo","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Jouve","given":"Mabel"},{"family":"Morath","given":"Jakob Paul"},{"family":"Primdal-Bengtson","given":"Bjarke"},{"family":"Dingli","given":"Florent"},{"family":"Loew","given":"Damarys"},{"family":"Tkach","given":"Mercedes"},{"family":"Théry","given":"Clotilde"}],"citation-key":"kowal2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1521230113","ISSN":"1091-6490","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,23]]},"language":"eng","page":"E968-977","PMCID":"PMC4776515","PMID":"26858453","source":"PubMed","title":"Proteomic comparison defines novel markers to characterize heterogeneous populations of extracellular vesicle subtypes","type":"article-journal","volume":"113"},

It is suggested that comparison of the observed shapes with theoretical shapes obtained by minimization of membrane-free energy in combination with electron microscopy is key in the assessment of CV identity. We found that shapes of CVs isolated from blood by repetitive centrifugation (up to 20.000 g) and washing, and observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) agreed well with theoretically observed shapes. It is indicated that these CVs are colloids deriving from residual blood cells, mostly platelets. SEM images of washed erythrocytes undergoing budding and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of isolated erythrocyte microvesicles likewise showed smooth shapes that we described as characteristic for colloidal CVs. Besides these, the CV isolates may contain other small particles, such as exosomes and viruses, as observed in isolates from tomato homogenate, however, we could not identify such particles in isolates from healthy human blood. Theory of deviatoric elasticity underlaying minimization of the membrane free energy and simulated two-component vesicles with the orientational ordering of anisotropic constituents are presented to indicate the interdependence of curvature—sorting of membrane constituents and their orientational ordering in strongly anisotropically curved regions.","author":[{"family":"Kralj-Iglič","given":"Veronika"},{"family":"Pocsfalvi","given":"Gabriella"},{"family":"Iglič","given":"Aleš"}],"citation-key":"kralj-iglic2022","container-title":"Physiology","DOI":"10.5772/intechopen.101639","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4210272548","title":"Morphology and Formation Mechanisms of Cellular Vesicles Harvested from Blood","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"kugeratski2021","abstract":"Exosomes are extracellular vesicles derived from the endosomal compartment that are potentially involved in intercellular communication. Here, we found that frequently used biomarkers of exosomes are heterogeneous, and do not exhibit universal utility across different cell types. To uncover ubiquitous and abundant proteins, we used an unbiased and quantitative proteomic approach based on super-stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (super-SILAC), coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. In total, 1,212 proteins were quantified in the proteome of exosomes, irrespective of the cellular source or isolation method. A cohort of 22 proteins was universally enriched. Fifteen proteins were consistently depleted in the proteome of exosomes compared to cells. Among the enriched proteins, we identified biogenesis-related proteins, GTPases and membrane proteins, such as CD47 and ITGB1. The cohort of depleted proteins in exosomes was predominantly composed of nuclear proteins. We identified syntenin-1 as a consistently abundant protein in exosomes from different cellular origins. Syntenin-1 is also present in exosomes across different species and biofluids, highlighting its potential use as a putative universal biomarker of exosomes. Our study provides a comprehensive quantitative atlas of core proteins ubiquitous to exosomes that can serve as a resource for the scientific community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kugeratski","given":"Fernanda G."},{"family":"Hodge","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Lilla","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"McAndrews","given":"Kathleen M."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xunian"},{"family":"Hwang","given":"Rosa F."},{"family":"Zanivan","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Kalluri","given":"Raghu"}],"citation-key":"kugeratski2021","container-title":"Nature Cell Biology","container-title-short":"Nat Cell Biol","DOI":"10.1038/s41556-021-00693-y","ISSN":"1476-4679","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Cell biology;High-throughput screening;Proteomics\nSubject_term_id: cell-biology;high-throughput-screening;proteomics","number":"6","page":"631-641","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Quantitative proteomics identifies the core proteome of exosomes with syntenin-1 as the highest abundant protein and a putative universal biomarker","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00693-y","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"kullenberg2016","abstract":"Context The concept of citizen science (CS) is currently referred to by many actors inside and outside science and research. Several descriptions of this purportedly new approach of science are often heard in connection with large datasets and the possibilities of mobilizing crowds outside science to assists with observations and classifications. However, other accounts refer to CS as a way of democratizing science, aiding concerned communities in creating data to influence policy and as a way of promoting political decision processes involving environment and health. Objective In this study we analyse two datasets (N = 1935, N = 633) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) with the aim of giving a scientometric description of what the concept of CS entails. We account for its development over time, and what strands of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms. Results Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935), but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms has emerged for the collection and classification of data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Kullenberg","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Kasperowski","given":"Dick"}],"citation-key":"kullenberg2016","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0147152","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,14]]},"language":"en","page":"e0147152","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"What Is Citizen Science? – A Scientometric Meta-Analysis","title-short":"What Is Citizen Science?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147152","volume":"11"},

While a variety of stiffness-tunable biomaterials, reviewed here, have been developed to mimic the rigidity of the tumor extracellular matrix, culture systems that can recapitulate the broader extracellular context of the tumor microenvironment (including pH and temperature) remain comparably unexplored, partially due to the difficulty in independently tuning these parameters. Here, we investigate a self-assembled polypeptide network hydrogel as a cell culture platform and demonstrate that the culture parameters, including the substrate stiffness, extracellular pH and temperature, can be independently controlled. We then use this biomaterial as a cell culture substrate to assess the effect of stiffness, pH and temperature on Suit2 cells, a pancreatic cancer cell line, and demonstrate that these microenvironmental factors can regulate two critical transcription factors in cancer: yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1A).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Lachowski","given":"Dariusz"},{"family":"Matellan","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Cortes","given":"Ernesto"},{"family":"Saiani","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Aline F."},{"family":"Río Hernández","given":"Armando E.","non-dropping-particle":"del"}],"citation-key":"lachowski2021","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers13133286","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"13","page":"3286","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Self-Assembling Polypeptide Hydrogels as a Platform to Recapitulate the Tumor Microenvironment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/13/3286","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"lam2011","abstract":"This paper employs the three concepts of ‘gold’ (financial rewards), ‘ribbon’ (reputational/career rewards) and ‘puzzle’ (intrinsic satisfaction) to examine the extrinsic and intrinsic aspects of scientists’ motivation for pursuing commercial activities. The study is based on 36 individual interviews and an on-line questionnaire survey of 735 scientists from five major UK research universities. It finds that there is a diversity of motivations for commercial engagement, and that many do so for reputational and intrinsic reasons and that financial rewards play a relatively small part. The paper draws on self-determination theory in social psychology to analyse the relationship between scientists’ value orientations with regard to commercial engagement and their personal motivations. It finds that those with traditional beliefs about the separation of science from commerce are more likely to be extrinsically motivated, using commercialization as a means to obtain resources to support their quest for the ‘ribbon’. In contrast, those identify closely with entrepreneurial norms are intrinsically motivated by the autonomy and ‘puzzle-solving’ involved in applied commercial research while also motivated by the ‘gold’. The study highlights the primacy of scientists’ self-motivation, and suggests that a fuller explanation of their commercial behaviour will need to consider a broader mix of motives to include the social and affective aspects of intrinsic motivation. In conclusion, the paper argues that policy to encourage commercial engagement should build on reputational and intrinsic rather than purely financial motivations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lam","given":"Alice"}],"citation-key":"lam2011","container-title":"Research Policy","container-title-short":"Research Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.respol.2011.09.002","ISSN":"0048-7333","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1354-1368","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What motivates academic scientists to engage in research commercialization: ‘Gold’, ‘ribbon’ or ‘puzzle’?","title-short":"What motivates academic scientists to engage in research commercialization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311001703","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"lee2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            Current clinical tools for breast cancer (BC) diagnosis are insufficient but liquid biopsy of different bodily fluids has recently emerged as a minimally invasive strategy that provides a real-time snapshot of tumour biomarkers for early diagnosis, active surveillance of progression, and post-treatment recurrence. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized membranous structures 50–1000 nm in diameter that are released by cells into biological fluids. EVs contain proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids which play pivotal roles in tumourigenesis and metastasis through cell-to-cell communication. Proteins and miRNAs from small EVs (sEV), which range in size from 50–150 nm, are being investigated as a potential source for novel BC biomarkers using mass spectrometry-based proteomics and next-generation sequencing. This review covers recent developments in sEV isolation and single sEV analysis technologies and summarises the sEV protein and miRNA biomarkers identified for BC diagnosis, prognosis, and chemoresistance. The limitations of current sEV biomarker research are discussed along with future perspective applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Yujin"},{"family":"Ni","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Beretov","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Wasinger","given":"Valerie C."},{"family":"Graham","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yong"}],"citation-key":"lee2023","container-title":"Molecular Cancer","container-title-short":"Mol Cancer","DOI":"10.1186/s12943-023-01741-x","ISSN":"1476-4598","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,16]]},"language":"en","page":"33","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recent advances of small extracellular vesicle biomarkers in breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-023-01741-x","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"lelli2007","abstract":"Current grid technologies offer unlimited computational power and storage capacity for scientific research and business activities in heterogeneous areas all over the world. Thanks to the grid, different virtual organisations can operate together in order to achieve common goals. However, concrete use cases demand a closer interaction between various types of instruments accessible from the grid on the one hand and the classical grid infrastructure, typically composed of Computing and Storage Elements, on the other. We cope with this open problem by proposing and realising the first release of the Instrument Element (IE), a new grid component that provides the computational/data grid with an abstraction of real instruments, and grid users with a more interactive interface to control them. In this paper we discuss in detail the implemented software architecture for this new component and we present concrete use cases where the IE has been successfully integrated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Lelli","given":"F."},{"family":"Frizziero","given":"E."},{"family":"Gulmini","given":"M."},{"family":"Maron","given":"G."},{"family":"Orlando","given":"S."},{"family":"Petrucci","given":"A."},{"family":"Squizzato","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"lelli2007","container-title":"International Journal of Web and Grid Services","container-title-short":"IJWGS","DOI":"10.1504/IJWGS.2007.014953","ISSN":"1741-1106, 1741-1114","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"en","page":"239","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The many faces of the integration of instruments and the grid","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.inderscience.com/link.php?id=14953","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"leon2021","abstract":"Brain evolution in early Homo\nHuman brains are larger than and structurally different from the brains of the great apes. Ponce de León et al. explored the timing of the origins of the structurally modern human brain (see the Perspective by Beaudet). By comparing endocasts, representations of the inner surface of fossil brain cases, from early Homo from Africa, Georgia, and Southeast Asia, they show that these structural innovations emerged later than the first dispersal of the genus from Africa, and were probably in place by 1.7 to 1.5 million years ago. The modern humanlike brain organization emerged in cerebral regions thought to be related to toolmaking, social cognition, and language. Their findings suggest that brain reorganization was not a prerequisite for dispersals from Africa, and that there might have been more than one long-range dispersal of early Homo.\nScience, this issue p. 165; see also p. 124\nThe brains of modern humans differ from those of great apes in size, shape, and cortical organization, notably in frontal lobe areas involved in complex cognitive tasks, such as social cognition, tool use, and language. When these differences arose during human evolution is a question of ongoing debate. Here, we show that the brains of early Homo from Africa and Western Asia (Dmanisi) retained a primitive, great ape–like organization of the frontal lobe. By contrast, African Homo younger than 1.5 million years ago, as well as all Southeast Asian Homo erectus, exhibited a more derived, humanlike brain organization. Frontal lobe reorganization, once considered a hallmark of earliest Homo in Africa, thus evolved comparatively late, and long after Homo first dispersed from Africa.\nEarly Homo evolved a modern humanlike brain organization only after its first dispersal from Africa.\nEarly Homo evolved a modern humanlike brain organization only after its first dispersal from Africa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"León","given":"Marcia S.

Quantitative measurement of the biophysical parameters of nanoparticle−protein interaction will improve such understanding, which could be conveniently performed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) as demonstrated in the present study. Two interaction situations were identified. Stable nanoparticle−protein complexes were resolved from the free nanoparticles and the proteins by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Transient complexes with fast association/dissociation rates showed distinct mobility change from the free nanoparticles in affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). Interactions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with the Fe3O4 nanoparticles (average diameters of 8 and 10 nm) and with the Au nanoparticles (average diameters of 5 and 10 nm) displayed slow and fast binding kinetics, respectively. Using the Hill equation, we could calculate the dissociation constants (KD) and cooperativity coefficients (n). Impacts on nanoparticle−protein interaction from the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the incubation buffer were evaluated on the basis of the KD and n values to interpret the interaction driving forces. Our study demonstrated the high simplicity and flexibility of CE in probing the interaction of proteins with diverse particles. The separation power of CE should also facilitate studies of the multicomponent interaction systems for investigating how adsorption onto nanoparticles could affect the protein−protein or protein−small molecule interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Ni"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Shang"},{"family":"He","given":"Le"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Wenwan"}],"citation-key":"li2010","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

Fluorophore-functionalized aptamers and quencher-carrying strands hybridized in duplex are coupled with streptavidin (SA)-functionalized nanoparticles to form a AgNP-enhanced FRET sensor. The resulting sensor shows lower background fluorescence intensity in the duplex state due to the FRET effect between fluorophores and quenchers. Upon the addition of PDGF-BB, the quencher-carrying strands (BHQ-2) of the duplex are displaced leading to the disruption of the FRET effect. As a result, the fluorescent intensity of the fluorophore–aptamer within the proximity of the AgNP is increased. When compared to the gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based FRET and bare FRET sensors, the AgNP-based FRET sensor showed remarkable increase in fluorescence intensity, target specificity, and sensitivity.

  {"id":"li2019","abstract":"The reasons for restricting continuous flow polymerase chain reaction (CF-PCR) microfluidic chip from lab to application are that it is not portable and requires costly external precision pumps for sample injection. Herein, we employed water as the substitute for PCR solution, and investigated the effect of the cross-section, width-to-depth ratio, and the length ratio for three temperature zones of the micro channel on the thermal and flow distribution of fluid in micro tube by finite element analysis. Results show that the central velocity is uniform and stable velocity occupies the most if the cross-section is rectangular. The deviation between predefined temperature and theoretical temperature is slight and the fluid flux is the most if width-to-depth ratio is 1:1. It is suitable for the short DNA replication if the high temperature zone Wh is larger than the low temperature zone Wl, and vice versa. Then a portable CF-PCR microfluidic chip was fabricated and an automatic sample injection system was developed. As an application, we have successfully amplified the DNA of Treponema denticola in the chip within 8 min.

Special EV surface protein patterns in serum have the potential as noninvasive biomarker candidates to distinguish several disease-related patterns ex vivo or in vivo. EVs were isolated from the serum of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) patients, and healthy volunteers. EVs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis, and EV surface protein profiles were analyzed by multiplex bead-based flow cytometry to identify tumor- or immune system-related EVs of AML, ALL, CLL, and healthy samples.

By differentiating unencapsulated mRNAs, empty LNPs and mRNA-loaded LNPs via coincidence analysis of fluorescent tags on different LNP components, and quantitatively resolving single-mRNA fluorescence, we reveal that a commonly referenced benchmark formulation using DLin-MC3 as the ionizable lipid contains mostly 2 mRNAs per loaded LNP with a presence of 40%–80% empty LNPs depending on the assembly conditions. Systematic analysis of different formulations with control variables reveals a kinetically controlled assembly mechanism that governs the payload distribution and capacity in LNPs.

In this study, the power of unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms is harnessed to analyze chemical reactivity images obtained dynamically by reflectivity microscopy in combination with ex situ scanning electron microscopy to identify and cluster the chemical reactivity of particles in Al alloy. The ML analysis uncovers three distinct clusters of reactivity from unlabeled datasets. A detailed examination of representative reactivity patterns confirms the chemical communication of generated OH− fluxes within particles, as supported by statistical analysis of size distribution and finite element modelling (FEM).

  {"id":"lischnig2022","abstract":"There is a long-held consensus that several proteins are unique to small extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes. However, recent studies have shown that several of these markers can also be present in other subpopulations of EVs to a similar degree. Furthermore, few markers have been identified as enriched or uniquely present in larger EVs, such as microvesicles. The aim of this study was to address these issues by conducting an in-depth comparison of the proteome of large and small EVs. Large (16,500g) and small EVs (118,000g) were isolated from three cell lines using a combination of differential ultracentrifugation and a density cushion and quantitative mass spectrometry (tandem mass tag–liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry) was used to identify differently enriched proteins in large and small EVs. In total, 6493 proteins were quantified, with 818 and 1567 proteins significantly enriched in small and large EVs, respectively. Tetraspanins, ADAMs and ESCRT proteins, as well as SNAREs and Rab proteins associated with endosomes were enriched in small EVs compared with large EVs, whereas ribosomal, mitochondrial, and nuclear proteins, as well as proteins involved in cytokinesis, were enriched in large EVs compared with small EVs. However, Flotillin-1 was not differently expressed in large and small EVs. In conclusion, our study shows that the proteome of large and small EVs are substantially dissimilar. We validated several proteins previously suggested to be enriched in either small or large EVs (e.g., ADAM10 and Mitofilin, respectively), and we suggest several additional novel protein markers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Lischnig","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Bergqvist","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Ochiya","given":"Takahiro"},{"family":"Lässer","given":"Cecilia"}],"citation-key":"lischnig2022","container-title":"Molecular & Cellular Proteomics","container-title-short":"Molecular & Cellular Proteomics","DOI":"10.1016/j.mcpro.2022.100273","ISSN":"1535-9476","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100273","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Quantitative Proteomics Identifies Proteins Enriched in Large and Small Extracellular Vesicles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947622000810","volume":"21"},

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have a very poor overall five-year survival rate of only 10–20%. Currently, TNM staging is the gold standard for predicting overall survival and selecting optimal initial treatment options for NSCLC patients, including those with curable stages of disease. However, many patients with locoregionally-confined NSCLC relapse and die despite curative-intent interventions, indicating a need for intensified, individualised therapies. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the phenotypic depolarisation of epithelial cells to elongated, mesenchymal cells, is associated with metastatic and treatment-refractive cancer. We demonstrate here that EMT-induced protein changes in small extracellular vesicles are detectable in NSCLC patients and have prognostic significance. Overall, this work describes a novel prognostic biomarker signature that identifies potentially-curable NSCLC patients at risk of developing metastatic NSCLC, thereby enabling implementation of personalised treatment decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Lobb","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Visan","given":"Kekoolani S."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Li-Ying"},{"family":"Norris","given":"Emma L."},{"family":"Hastie","given":"Marcus L."},{"family":"Everitt","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ian A."},{"family":"Bowman","given":"Rayleen V."},{"family":"Siva","given":"Shankar"},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Jill E."},{"family":"Gorman","given":"Jeffrey J."},{"family":"MacManus","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Leimgruber","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Fong","given":"Kwun M."},{"family":"Möller","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"lobb2023","container-title":"Communications Biology","container-title-short":"Commun Biol","DOI":"10.1038/s42003-022-04350-4","ISSN":"2399-3642","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-9","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"An epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced extracellular vesicle prognostic signature in non-small cell lung cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04350-4","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"lof2019","abstract":"Significance\n            The physiological function of proteins is often critically regulated by mechanical forces acting on them. Single-molecule manipulation techniques such as atomic force microscopy or optical tweezers have enabled unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying such force regulation. Current limitations include the resolution at low forces and low throughput. We here introduce a versatile, modular approach for force measurements on proteins in magnetic tweezers that allows for probing dozens of single molecules in parallel, in a wide force range including very low forces <1 pN. We demonstrate the utility of this assay by elucidating regulatory low-force transitions within von Willebrand factor, a vascular protein that is activated for its critical role in hemostasis by hydrodynamic forces in the bloodstream.\n          , \n            \n              Single-molecule force spectroscopy has provided unprecedented insights into protein folding, force regulation, and function. So far, the field has relied primarily on atomic force microscope and optical tweezers assays that, while powerful, are limited in force resolution, throughput, and require feedback for constant force measurements. Here, we present a modular approach based on magnetic tweezers (MT) for highly multiplexed protein force spectroscopy. Our approach uses elastin-like polypeptide linkers for the specific attachment of proteins, requiring only short peptide tags on the protein of interest. The assay extends protein force spectroscopy into the low force (<1 pN) regime and enables parallel and ultra-stable measurements at constant forces. We present unfolding and refolding data for the small, single-domain protein ddFLN4, commonly used as a molecular fingerprint in force spectroscopy, and for the large, multidomain dimeric protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) that is critically involved in primary hemostasis. For both proteins, our measurements reveal exponential force dependencies of unfolding and refolding rates. We directly resolve the stabilization of the VWF A2 domain by Ca\n              2+\n              and discover transitions in the VWF C domain stem at low forces that likely constitute the first steps of VWF’s mechano-activation. Probing the force-dependent lifetime of biotin–streptavidin bonds, we find that monovalent streptavidin constructs with specific attachment geometry are significantly more force stable than commercial, multivalent streptavidin. We expect our modular approach to enable multiplexed force-spectroscopy measurements for a wide range of proteins, in particular in the physiologically relevant low-force regime.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Löf","given":"Achim"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Philipp U."},{"family":"Sedlak","given":"Steffen M."},{"family":"Gruber","given":"Sophia"},{"family":"Obser","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Brehm","given":"Maria A."},{"family":"Benoit","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Lipfert","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"lof2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"louys2021","abstract":"The arrival of modern humans into previously unoccupied island ecosystems is closely linked to widespread extinction, and a key reason cited for Pleistocene megafauna extinction is anthropogenic overhunting. A common assumption based on late Holocene records is that humans always negatively impact insular biotas, which requires an extrapolation of recent human behavior and technology into the archaeological past. Hominins have been on islands since at least the early Pleistocene and Homo sapiens for at least 50 thousand y (ka). Over such lengthy intervals it is scarcely surprising that significant evolutionary, behavioral, and cultural changes occurred. However, the deep-time link between human arrival and island extinctions has never been explored globally. Here, we examine archaeological and paleontological records of all Pleistocene islands with a documented hominin presence to examine whether humans have always been destructive agents. We show that extinctions at a global level cannot be associated with Pleistocene hominin arrival based on current data and are difficult to disentangle from records of environmental change. It is not until the Holocene that large-scale changes in technology, dispersal, demography, and human behavior visibly affect island ecosystems. The extinction acceleration we are currently experiencing is thus not inherent but rather part of a more recent cultural complex.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Louys","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Braje","given":"Todd J."},{"family":"Chang","given":"Chun-Hsiang"},{"family":"Cosgrove","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Scott M."},{"family":"Fujita","given":"Masaki"},{"family":"Hawkins","given":"Stuart"},{"family":"Ingicco","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Kawamura","given":"Ai"},{"family":"MacPhee","given":"Ross D.

Lundgren et al. tested whether feral equids (horses and donkeys) reintroduced to desert regions in the North American southwest dig wells that provide ecosystem-level benefits. They found that equid-dug wells increased water availability, were used by a large number of species, and decreased distance between water sources. Abandoned wells also led to increased germination in key riparian tree species.

Vertebrate richness and activity were higher at equid wells than at adjacent dry sites, and, by mimicking flood disturbance, equid wells became nurseries for riparian trees.

Our study proposed to characterize and compare circulating EVs isolated from the plasma of chronic Chagas disease (CCD) patients and controls. For this, peripheral blood was collected from patients and controls, and mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and stimulated with parasite EVs, showing that patient cells released fewer EVs than control cells. Then, after plasma separation followed by EV total shedding enrichment, the samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation to isolate the circulating EVs, which then had their size and concentration characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). This showed that patients had a lower concentration of circulating EVs while there were no differences in size, corroborating the in vitro data. Additionally, circulating EVs were incubated with THP-1 cells (macrophages) that, after the interaction, had their supernatant analyzed by ELISA for cytokine detection. In relation to their ability to induce cytokine production, the CCD patient EVs were able to induce a differential production of IFN-γ and IL-17 in relation to controls, with differences being more evident in earlier/less severe stages of the disease. In summary, a decreased concentration of circulating EVs associated with differential activation of the immunological system in patients with CCD is related to parasite persistence and the establishment of chronic disease. It is also a potential biomarker for monitoring disease progression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Madeira","given":"Rafael Pedro"},{"family":"Dal’Mas Romera","given":"Lavínia Maria"},{"family":"Cássia Buck","given":"Paula","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Mady","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Ianni","given":"Barbara Maria"},{"family":"Torrecilhas","given":"Ana Claudia"}],"citation-key":"madeira2021","container-title":"Journal of Immunology Research","DOI":"10.1155/2021/6650670","ISSN":"2314-8861","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,12]]},"language":"en","page":"e6650670","publisher":"Hindawi","source":"www.hindawi.com","title":"New Biomarker in Chagas Disease: Extracellular Vesicles Isolated from Peripheral Blood in Chronic Chagas Disease Patients Modulate the Human Immune Response","title-short":"New Biomarker in Chagas Disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2021/6650670/","volume":"2021"},
  {"id":"madrian2001","abstract":"This paper analyzes the impact of automatic enrollment on 401(k) savings behavior. We have two key findings. First, 401(k) participation is significantly higher under automatic enrollment. Second, a substantial fraction of 401(k) participants hired under automatic enrollment retain both the default contribution rate and fund allocation even though few employees hired before automatic enrollment picked this particular outcome. This \"default\" behavior appears to result from participant inertia and from employee perceptions of the default as investment advice. These findings have implications for the design of 401(k) savings plans as well as for any type of Social Security reform that includes personal accounts over which individuals have control. They also shed light more generally on the importance of both economic and noneconomic (behavioral) factors in the determination of individual savings behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Madrian","given":"Brigitte C."},{"family":"Shea","given":"Dennis F."}],"citation-key":"madrian2001","container-title":"The Quarterly Journal of Economics","ISSN":"0033-5533","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"1149-1187","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Power of Suggestion: Inertia in 401(k) Participation and Savings Behavior","title-short":"The Power of Suggestion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2696456","volume":"116"},

Previous iSCAT studies have approximated the point spread function in iSCAT by a Gaussian intensity distribution. However, recent efforts to track the mobility of nanoparticles in challenging speckle environments and over extended axial ranges has necessitated a quantitative description of the interferometric point spread function (iPSF). We present a robust vectorial diffraction model for the iPSF in tandem with experimental measurements and rigorous FDTD simulations. We examine the iPSF under various imaging scenarios to understand how aberrations due to the experimental configuration encode information about the nanoparticle. We show that the lateral shape of the iPSF can be used to achieve nanometric three-dimensional localization over an extended axial range on the order of 10&#x2005;&#x00B5;m either by means of a fit to an analytical model or calibration-free unsupervised machine learning.

  {"id":"malburet2022","abstract":"Messenger RNA vaccines have come into the spotlight as a promising and adaptive alternative to conventional vaccine approaches. The efficacy of mRNA vaccines relies on the ability of mRNA to reach the cytoplasm of cells, where it can be translated into proteins of interest, allowing it to trigger the immune response. However, unprotected mRNA is unstable and susceptible to degradation by exo- and endonucleases, and its negative charges are electrostatically repulsed by the anionic cell membranes. Therefore, mRNA needs a delivery system that protects the nucleic acid from degradation and allows it to enter into the cells. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent a nonviral leading vector for mRNA delivery. Physicochemical parameters of LNPs, including their size and their charge, directly impact their in vivo behavior and, therefore, their cellular internalization. In this work, Taylor dispersion analysis (TDA) was used as a new methodology for the characterization of the size and polydispersity of LNPs, and capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used for the determination of LNP global charge. The results obtained were compared with those obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and laser Doppler electrophoresis (LDE).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Malburet","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Leclercq","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Cotte","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Thiebaud","given":"Jérôme"},{"family":"Bazin","given":"Emilie"},{"family":"Garinot","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Cottet","given":"Hervé"}],"citation-key":"malburet2022","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

Kymographs are single images that represent the motion of dynamic processes and are widely used in live-cell imaging. Although they contain the full range of dynamics, it is not straightforward to extract this quantitative information in a reliable way. Here we present two complementary, publicly available software tools, KymographClear and KymographDirect, that have the power to reveal detailed insight in dynamic processes.

KymographDirect is a stand-alone tool to extract quantitative information from kymographs obtained from a wide range of dynamic processes in an automated way, with high accuracy and reliability. We discuss the concepts behind these software tools, validate them using simulated data, and test them on experimental data. We show that these tools can be used to extract motility parameters from a diverse set of cell-biological experiments in an automated and user-friendly way.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Mangeol","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Prevo","given":"Bram"},{"family":"Peterman","given":"Erwin J.

Estimating abundance for species that are extinct, especially those long extinct, is a much trickier endeavor.

Here, we use the relationship between population density and body mass among living species combined with our substantial knowledge of Tyrannosaurus rex to calculate population variables and preservation rates for postjuvenile T. rex. We estimate that its abundance at any one time was ~20,000 individuals, that it persisted for ~127,000 generations, and that the total number of T. rex that ever lived was ~2.5 billion individuals, with a fossil recovery rate of 1 per ~80 million individuals or 1 per 16,000 individuals where its fossils are most abundant. The uncertainties in these values span more than two orders of magnitude, largely because of the variance in the density–body mass relationship rather than variance in the paleobiological input variables.\nRelationship between body mass and population density elucidates the potential population biology of Tyrannosaurus rex.\nRelationship between body mass and population density elucidates the potential population biology of Tyrannosaurus rex.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Marshall","given":"Charles R."},{"family":"Latorre","given":"Daniel V."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Connor J."},{"family":"Frank","given":"Tanner M."},{"family":"Magoulick","given":"Katherine M."},{"family":"Zimmt","given":"Joshua B."},{"family":"Poust","given":"Ashley W."}],"citation-key":"marshall2021","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.abc8300","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6539","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,16]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Effective target search requires constant screening of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and a 30 ms upper limit for screening was recently found. To further quantify the rapid switching between DNA-bound and freely-diffusing states of dCas9, we developed an open-microscopy framework, the miCube, and introduce Monte-Carlo diffusion distribution analysis (MC-DDA). Our analysis reveals that dCas9 is screening PAMs 40% of the time in Gram-positive Lactoccous lactis, averaging 17 ± 4 ms per binding event. Using heterogeneous dCas9 expression, we determine the number of cellular target-containing plasmids and derive the copy number dependent Cas9 cleavage. Furthermore, we show that dCas9 is not irreversibly bound to target sites but can still interfere with plasmid replication. Taken together, our quantitative data facilitates further optimization of the CRISPR-Cas toolbox.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Martens","given":"Koen J.

Simultaneously acquiring spectral information (spectrally resolved SMLM, sSMLM) has been hampered by several challenges: an increased complexity of the optical detection pathway, lower accessible emitter densities, and compromised spatio-spectral resolution. Here we present a single-component, low-cost implementation of sSMLM that addresses these challenges. Using a low-dispersion transmission grating positioned close to the image plane, the +1stdiffraction order is minimally elongated and is analyzed using existing single-molecule localization algorithms. The distance between the 0th and 1st order provides accurate information on the spectral properties of individual emitters. This method enables a 5-fold higher emitter density while discriminating between fluorophores whose peak emissions are less than 15 nm apart.

Biochemical validation confirmed the presence of preferred partners of commonly used exosome markers in EVs: CD81/ADAM10/ITGB1, and CD63/syntenin. We then compared EVs from control and HIV-1-infected cells. HIV infection altered EV profiles of several cellular proteins, including MOV10 and SPN, which became incorporated into HIV virions, and SERINC3, which was re-routed to non-viral EVs in a Nef-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that SERINC3 controls the surface composition of EVs. Our workflow provides an unbiased approach for identifying candidate markers and potential regulators of EV subtypes. It can be widely applied to in vitro experimental systems for investigating physiological or pathological modifications of EV release.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin Jaular","given":"Lorena"},{"family":"Nevo","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Théry","given":"Clotilde"}],"citation-key":"martinjaular2021","container-title":"The EMBO Journal","DOI":"10.15252/embj.2020105492","ISSN":"0261-4189","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,15]]},"page":"e105492","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"embopress.org (Atypon)","title":"Unbiased proteomic profiling of host cell extracellular vesicle composition and dynamics upon HIV-1 infection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embj.2020105492","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"mast2021","abstract":"For many years, nanomedicine is pushing the boundaries of drug delivery. When applying these novel therapeutics, safety considerations are not only a key concern when entering clinical trials but also an important decision point in product development. Standing at the crossroads, nanomedicine may be able to escape the niche markets and achieve wider acceptance by the pharmaceutical industry. While there is a new generation of drug delivery systems, the extracellular vesicles, standing on the starting line, unresolved issues and new challenges emerge from their translation from bench to bedside. Some key features of injectable nanomedicines contribute to the predictability of the pharmacological and toxicological effects. So far, only a few of the physicochemical attributes of nanomedicines can be justified by a direct mathematical relationship between the in vitro and the in vivo responses. To further develop extracellular vesicles as drug carriers, we have to learn from more than 40 years of clinical experience in liposomal delivery and pass on this knowledge to the next generation. Our quick guide discusses relationships between physicochemical characteristics and the in vivo response, commonly referred to as in vitro-in vivo correlation. Further, we highlight the key role of computational methods, lay open current knowledge gaps, and question the established design strategies. Has the recent progress improved the predictability of targeted delivery or do we need another change in perspective?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Mast","given":"Marc-Phillip"},{"family":"Modh","given":"Harshvardhan"},{"family":"Champanhac","given":"Carole"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiong-Wei"},{"family":"Storm","given":"Gerrit"},{"family":"Krämer","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Mailänder","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Pastorin","given":"Giorgia"},{"family":"Wacker","given":"Matthias G."}],"citation-key":"mast2021","container-title":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","container-title-short":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.addr.2021.113829","ISSN":"0169-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,24]]},"language":"en","page":"113829","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Nanomedicine at the crossroads – A quick guide for IVIVC","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X21002210"},

  {"id":"mathieson2018","abstract":"Farming was first introduced to Europe in the mid-seventh millennium bc, and was associated with migrants from Anatolia who settled in the southeast before spreading throughout Europe. Here, to understand the dynamics of this process, we analysed genome-wide ancient DNA data from 225 individuals who lived in southeastern Europe and surrounding regions between 12000 and 500 bc. We document a west–east cline of ancestry in indigenous hunter-gatherers and, in eastern Europe, the early stages in the formation of Bronze Age steppe ancestry. We show that the first farmers of northern and western Europe dispersed through southeastern Europe with limited hunter-gatherer admixture, but that some early groups in the southeast mixed extensively with hunter-gatherers without the sex-biased admixture that prevailed later in the north and west. We also show that southeastern Europe continued to be a nexus between east and west after the arrival of farmers, with intermittent genetic contact with steppe populations occurring up to 2,000 years earlier than the migrations from the steppe that ultimately replaced much of the population of northern Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Mathieson","given":"Iain"},{"family":"Alpaslan-Roodenberg","given":"Songül"},{"family":"Posth","given":"Cosimo"},{"family":"Szécsényi-Nagy","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Rohland","given":"Nadin"},{"family":"Mallick","given":"Swapan"},{"family":"Olalde","given":"Iñigo"},{"family":"Broomandkhoshbacht","given":"Nasreen"},{"family":"Candilio","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Cheronet","given":"Olivia"},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Ferry","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Gamarra","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"Fortes","given":"Gloria González"},{"family":"Haak","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Harney","given":"Eadaoin"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Eppie"},{"family":"Keating","given":"Denise"},{"family":"Krause-Kyora","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Kucukkalipci","given":"Isil"},{"family":"Michel","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Mittnik","given":"Alissa"},{"family":"Nägele","given":"Kathrin"},{"family":"Novak","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Oppenheimer","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Pfrengle","given":"Saskia"},{"family":"Sirak","given":"Kendra"},{"family":"Stewardson","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Vai","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Alexandrov","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Alt","given":"Kurt W."},{"family":"Andreescu","given":"Radian"},{"family":"Antonović","given":"Dragana"},{"family":"Ash","given":"Abigail"},{"family":"Atanassova","given":"Nadezhda"},{"family":"Bacvarov","given":"Krum"},{"family":"Gusztáv","given":"Mende Balázs"},{"family":"Bocherens","given":"Hervé"},{"family":"Bolus","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Boroneanţ","given":"Adina"},{"family":"Boyadzhiev","given":"Yavor"},{"family":"Budnik","given":"Alicja"},{"family":"Burmaz","given":"Josip"},{"family":"Chohadzhiev","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Conard","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Cottiaux","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Čuka","given":"Maja"},{"family":"Cupillard","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Drucker","given":"Dorothée G."},{"family":"Elenski","given":"Nedko"},{"family":"Francken","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Galabova","given":"Borislava"},{"family":"Ganetsovski","given":"Georgi"},{"family":"Gély","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Hajdu","given":"Tamás"},{"family":"Handzhyiska","given":"Veneta"},{"family":"Harvati","given":"Katerina"},{"family":"Higham","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Iliev","given":"Stanislav"},{"family":"Janković","given":"Ivor"},{"family":"Karavanić","given":"Ivor"},{"family":"Kennett","given":"Douglas J."},{"family":"Komšo","given":"Darko"},{"family":"Kozak","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Labuda","given":"Damian"},{"family":"Lari","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Lazar","given":"Catalin"},{"family":"Leppek","given":"Maleen"},{"family":"Leshtakov","given":"Krassimir"},{"family":"Vetro","given":"Domenico Lo"},{"family":"Los","given":"Dženi"},{"family":"Lozanov","given":"Ivaylo"},{"family":"Malina","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Martini","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"McSweeney","given":"Kath"},{"family":"Meller","given":"Harald"},{"family":"Menđušić","given":"Marko"},{"family":"Mirea","given":"Pavel"},{"family":"Moiseyev","given":"Vyacheslav"},{"family":"Petrova","given":"Vanya"},{"family":"Price","given":"T.

In our paper, we report a novel approach to this problem. As a substrate material for our LOC device, we choose soda lime glass plates in which we prepare channel optical waveguides, with the use of an ion exchange technique. Then, the microfluidic system is fabricated in the same substrate utilising standard photolithography and wet etching methods. As a result, we obtain a truly integrated, monolithic microsystem, containing both microchannels and microoptics, fabricated in the same substrate. The waveguiding optics is used to excite the fluorescence in the microchannels, while for the fluorescent beam collection, various approaches are tested: waveguide, free space and fibre optics. The quantitative results of the fluorescence experiments are also presented, namely calibration curves and level of detection values. Finally, an exemplary application of the system is demonstrated for the separation and detection of the mixture of Cy3 fluorescent dye and Cy3 tagged streptavidine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Mazurczyk","given":"Radoslaw"},{"family":"Vieillard","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Bouchard","given":"Aude"},{"family":"Hannes","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Krawczyk","given":"Stanislas"}],"citation-key":"mazurczyk2006","collection-title":"Eurosensors XIX","container-title":"Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical","container-title-short":"Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical","DOI":"10.1016/j.snb.2006.04.069","ISSN":"0925-4005","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",10,25]]},"page":"11-19","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A novel concept of the integrated fluorescence detection system and its application in a lab-on-a-chip microdevice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400506002619","volume":"118"},

Given the nearly 100% efficacy of current malaria therapeutics, the primary barrier to eradication is lack of early diagnosis of the infected population. However, there are multiple strains of malaria. Although significant efforts and resources have been invested in developing antibody-based diagnostic methods for Plasmodium falciparum, a rapid and easy to use screening method capable of detecting all malaria strains has not been realized. Yet, until the entire malaria-infected population receives treatment, the disease will continue to impact society. Here, we report the development of a portable, magneto-optic technology for early stage malaria diagnosis based on the detection of the malaria pigment, hemozoin. Using β-hematin, a hemozoin mimic, we demonstrate detection limits of <0.0081 μg/mL in 500 μL of whole rabbit blood with no additional reagents required.

  {"id":"mcnicholas2017","abstract":"Due to their size, small extracellular vesicles such as exosomes have been difficult to identify and to quantify. As the roles that exosomes play in intercellular signalling become clearer, so does their potential utility as both diagnostic biomarkers for disease and as therapeutic vectors. Accurate assessment of exosomes, both their number and their cargo, is important for continued advancement in the field of vesicle research. To that end, several technologies, including nanoparticle tracking analysis, have been developed to define the physical characteristics of vesicle preparations and determine their concentration. This chapter describes a method for identifying the size and concentration of a subpopulation of vesicles in biological samples, using nanoparticle tracking analysis.

  {"id":"medintz2005","abstract":"One of the fastest moving and most exciting interfaces of nanotechnology is the use of quantum dots (QDs) in biology. The unique optical properties of QDs make them appealing as in vivo and in vitro fluorophores in a variety of biological investigations, in which traditional fluorescent labels based on organic molecules fall short of providing long-term stability and simultaneous detection of multiple signals. The ability to make QDs water soluble and target them to specific biomolecules has led to promising applications in cellular labelling, deep-tissue imaging, assay labelling and as efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer donors. Despite recent progress, much work still needs to be done to achieve reproducible and robust surface functionalization and develop flexible bioconjugation techniques. In this review, we look at current methods for preparing QD bioconjugates as well as presenting an overview of applications. The potential of QDs in biology has just begun to be realized and new avenues will arise as our ability to manipulate these materials improves.","author":[{"family":"Medintz","given":"Igor L."},{"family":"Uyeda","given":"H.

We then describe the unique QD photophysical properties of direct relevance to FRET and summarize the main advantages offered, along with some of the limitations encountered by QDs as exciton donors and/or acceptors. Next we describe the overall progress made and discuss a few representative examples where QD-based FRET sensing of specific biological processes has been demonstrated. We also detail some of the advances of single molecule FRET using QD-conjugates and highlight the unique information that can be extracted.

Static diffusers were also placed at the input and output faces of the fiber bundle, thus introducing the spatial as well as angular diversity of illumination. Experiments were carried out both in free space and in imaging geometry configuration. Standard deviation, speckle contrast and signal-to-noise ratio of the images were computed, and the results were compared with those of white light illumination.

  {"id":"merryweather2021","abstract":"The key to advancing lithium-ion battery technology—in particular, fast charging—is the ability to follow and understand the dynamic processes occurring in functioning materials under realistic conditions, in real time and on the nano- to mesoscale. Imaging of lithium-ion dynamics during battery operation (operando imaging) at present requires sophisticated synchrotron X-ray1–7 or electron microscopy8,9 techniques, which do not lend themselves to high-throughput material screening. This limits rapid and rational materials improvements. Here we introduce a simple laboratory-based, optical interferometric scattering microscope10–13 to resolve nanoscopic lithium-ion dynamics in battery materials, and apply it to follow cycling of individual particles of the archetypal cathode material14,15, LixCoO2, within an electrode matrix. We visualize the insulator-to-metal, solid solution and lithium ordering phase transitions directly and determine rates of lithium diffusion at the single-particle level, identifying different mechanisms on charge and discharge. Finally, we capture the dynamic formation of domain boundaries between different crystal orientations associated with the monoclinic lattice distortion at the Li0.5CoO2 composition16. The high-throughput nature of our methodology allows many particles to be sampled across the entire electrode and in future will enable exploration of the role of dislocations, morphologies and cycling rate on battery degradation. The generality of our imaging concept means that it can be applied to study any battery electrode, and more broadly, systems where the transport of ions is associated with electronic or structural changes. Such systems include nanoionic films, ionic conducting polymers, photocatalytic materials and memristors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Merryweather","given":"Alice J."},{"family":"Schnedermann","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Jacquet","given":"Quentin"},{"family":"Grey","given":"Clare P."},{"family":"Rao","given":"Akshay"}],"citation-key":"merryweather2021","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03584-2","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7864","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","number":"7864","page":"522-528","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Operando optical tracking of single-particle ion dynamics in batteries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03584-2","volume":"594"},
  {"id":"merryweather2022","abstract":"To rationalize and improve the performance of newly developed high-rate battery electrode materials, it is crucial to understand the ion intercalation and degradation mechanisms occurring during realistic battery operation. Here we apply a laboratory-based operando optical scattering microscopy method to study micrometre-sized rod-like particles of the anode material Nb14W3O44 during high-rate cycling. We directly visualize elongation of the particles, which, by comparison with ensemble X-ray diffraction, allows us to determine changes in the state of charge of individual particles. A continuous change in scattering intensity with state of charge enables the observation of non-equilibrium kinetic phase separations within individual particles. Phase field modelling (informed by pulsed-field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance and electrochemical experiments) supports the kinetic origin of this separation, which arises from the state-of-charge dependence of the Li-ion diffusion coefficient. The non-equilibrium phase separations lead to particle cracking at high rates of delithiation, particularly in longer particles, with some of the resulting fragments becoming electrically disconnected on subsequent cycling. These results demonstrate the power of optical scattering microscopy to track rapid non-equilibrium processes that would be inaccessible with established characterization techniques.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Merryweather","given":"Alice J."},{"family":"Jacquet","given":"Quentin"},{"family":"Emge","given":"Steffen P."},{"family":"Schnedermann","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Rao","given":"Akshay"},{"family":"Grey","given":"Clare P."}],"citation-key":"merryweather2022","container-title":"Nature Materials","container-title-short":"Nat.

University faculties are challenged with the need to develop informed NOS views in several major student subpopulations, including science majors and nonscience majors. Research into NOS views of undergraduates, particularly science majors, has been limited. In this study, NOS views of undergraduates in introductory environmental science and upper-level animal behavior courses were measured using Likert items and open-ended prompts. Analysis revealed similarities in students' views between the two courses; both populations held a mix of naïve, transitional, and moderately informed views. Comparison of pre- and postcourse mean scores revealed significant changes in NOS views only in select aspects of NOS. Student scores on sections addressing six aspects of NOS were significantly different in most cases, showing notably uninformed views of the distinctions between scientific theories and laws. Evidence-based insight into student NOS views can aid in reforming undergraduate science courses and will add to faculty and researcher understanding of the impressions of science held by undergraduates, helping educators improve scientific literacy in future scientists and diverse college graduates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Marie C.

A total of 50 laboratories delivered results for the number concentration of 30 nm gold colloidal nanoparticles measured using particle tracking analysis (PTA), single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICP-MS), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) light spectroscopy, centrifugal liquid sedimentation (CLS) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The study provides quantitative data to evaluate the repeatability of these methods and their reproducibility in the measurement of number concentration of model nanoparticle systems following a common measurement protocol. We find that the population-averaging methods of SAXS, CLS and UV-Vis have high measurement repeatability and reproducibility, with between-labs variability of 2.6%, 11% and 1.4% respectively. However, results may be significantly biased for reasons including inaccurate material properties whose values are used to compute the number concentration. Particle-counting method results are less reproducibile than population-averaging methods, with measured between-labs variability of 68% and 46% for PTA and spICP-MS respectively.

Here we introduce an optical detection scheme for the real-time and label-free detection and recognition of single viruses and larger proteins. The method makes use of nanofluidic channels in combination with optical interferometry. Elastically scattered light from single viruses traversing a stationary laser focus is detected with a differential heterodyne interferometer and the resulting signal allows single viruses to be characterized individually. Heterodyne detection eliminates phase variations due to different particle trajectories, thus improving the recognition accuracy as compared to standard optical interferometry. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by resolving nanoparticles of various sizes, and detecting and recognizing different species of human viruses from a mixture.

  {"id":"mladenovic2024","abstract":"Current state-of-the-art tools for analyzing extracellular vesicles (EVs) offer either highly sensitive but unidimensional bulk measurements of EV components, or high-resolution multiparametric single particle analyses which lack standardization and appropriate reference materials. This limits the accuracy of assessment of marker abundance and overall marker distribution among individual EVs, and finally, the understanding of true EV heterogeneity.\nIn this study, we aimed to define the standardized operating procedures and reference material for fluorescent characterization of EVs with two commonly used EV analytical platforms - nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and nano-flow cytometry (nFCM).\nFor the first time, we achieved quantitative fluorescence analyses on ZetaView NTA and NanoAnalyzer nFCM instruments, by utilizing yellow-green FluoSpheres (FS) with assigned ERF (equivalent reference fluorophore) values. This standardization technique allowed for fluorescent EV signal to be expressed in ERF units (indicative of bound fluorescent antibodies per EV), thus enabling measurement of target protein marker abundance on individual EVs, and in the whole EV population. The NTA’s and nFCM’s limits of quantification (LoQ) were evaluated at 115 and 75 Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) molecules, respectively. To complement these shortcomings, in-line bulk fluorescence measurements in a plate reader were performed. This provided absolute marker quantification, and more insightful analyses of EV heterogeneity and marker stoichiometry.\nThe standardization method outlined in this work unlocks the full analytical potential of NTA and nFCM, enabling cross-platform data comparison. At the same time, it highlights some of the technical challenges and considerations, and thus contributes to the ongoing efforts towards development of EV analytical tools.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Mladenović","given":"Danilo"},{"family":"Brealey","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Peacock","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Zarovni","given":"Nataša"}],"citation-key":"mladenovic2024","DOI":"10.1101/2024.04.30.591813","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2024, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

  {"id":"moreira2020","abstract":"Although the relationship between competition and firm innovation has long been of scholarly interest, prior research has predominantly considered changes in internal research and development (R&D) as a strategic response to competitors’ actions. In this study, we focus on one of the most important and commonly observed contractual mechanisms used to acquire external technologies: technology licensing. Surprisingly, licensing has been mostly overlooked by prior studies examining the effect of competition on firms’ allocation of R&D. We take into account the unique properties of licensing and systematically link them to the demands arising from the competitive pressure caused by rivals’ launches of new products. Furthermore, we discuss how licensing-in decisions ultimately shape a firm’s subsequent innovation in areas where they are threatened by competitors and how such innovation depends on the cumulative R&D investments inside the organization into which licensed knowledge is added. We test our theoretical model through a longitudinal design that tracks the licensing-in and innovation outcomes of firms in the global biopharmaceutical industry. Accounting for the endogenous selection of firms into licensing, our findings illustrate that licensing-in is motivated by competitive pressures. We also find that licensing-in increases a firm’s capacity to innovate in areas where competitors have exerted pressure, particularly in the presence of cumulative R&D investments. In so doing, the paper anchors technology licensing as a key organizational action that helps increase our understanding of the important relationship between competition and innovation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Moreira","given":"Solon"},{"family":"Klueter","given":"Thomas Maximilian"},{"family":"Tasselli","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"moreira2020","container-title":"Organization Science","container-title-short":"Organization Science","DOI":"10.1287/orsc.2019.1337","ISSN":"1047-7039, 1526-5455","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"language":"en","page":"1012-1036","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Competition, Technology Licensing-in, and Innovation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.2019.1337","volume":"31"},

Existing explanations include the potentially unequal impact of parenthood on scholarship, but a lack of appropriate data has prevented its clear assessment. Here, we quantify the impact of parenthood on scholarship using an extensive survey of the timing of parenthood events, longitudinal publication data, and perceptions of research expectations among 3064 tenure-track faculty at 450 Ph.D.-granting computer science, history, and business departments across the United States and Canada, along with data on institution-specific parental leave policies. Parenthood explains most of the gender productivity gap by lowering the average short-term productivity of mothers, even as parents tend to be slightly more productive on average than nonparents. However, the size of productivity penalty for mothers appears to have shrunk over time. Women report that paid parental leave and adequate childcare are important factors in their recruitment and retention.

  {"id":"moritz2019","abstract":"Increasing maturation and dissemination of easy-to-use and affordable means of digital production (e.g. 3D printing), access to these in makerspaces and FabLabs as well as powerful tools and online platforms for virtual and collaborative product design enabled the highly efficient and innovative mode of open source to spill over from software to hardware. Open source technology has enormous potential to spur innovation and enhance technological literacy and thus contribute to socioeconomic and ecological sustainability. Like in software, open source hardware (OSH) projects and online communities have evolved in a broad range of technologies and applications. In these communities, people from all over the world with diverse backgrounds (students, researchers, consumers, users etc.) gather online to jointly develop, revise, improve and freely share hardware designs and documentation. Additionally, people may build, adapt, use and sell physical artefacts based on these designs in accordance with the notion of open source. The (potential) economic impact and value of open source hardware is hard to quantify as contributors usually do not get paid and users do not necessarily buy products from vendors. Nonetheless, value is created as in the case of Linux or Wikipedia. We applied established valuation methods for open source hardware to quantify cost savings and as a result the value of an open source magnetic resonance imaging device (MRI) currently under development by the Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI2). Depending on the scenario and the valuation method, we found that savings for healthcare systems from US$1.8 million up to US$222 million per year are possible in the near future making the case for public funding and private investment in open source technology development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Moritz","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Redlich","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Günyar","given":"Süleyman"},{"family":"Winter","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Wulfsberg","given":"Jens P."}],"citation-key":"moritz2019","container-title":"Journal of Open Hardware","DOI":"10.5334/joh.14","ISSN":"2514-1708","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,20]]},"language":"en","license":"Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:    Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution License  that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.

  {"id":"muller2017","abstract":"Infection with any of the 4 dengue virus serotypes results in a diverse range of symptoms, from mild undifferentiated fever to life-threatening hemorrhagic fever and shock. Given that dengue virus infection elicits such a broad range of clinical symptoms, early and accurate laboratory diagnosis is essential for appropriate patient management. Virus detection and serological conversion have been the main targets of diagnostic assessment for many years, however cross-reactivity of antibody responses among the flaviviruses has been a confounding issue in providing a differential diagnosis. Furthermore, there is no single, definitive diagnostic biomarker that is present across the entire period of patient presentation, particularly in those experiencing a secondary dengue infection. Nevertheless, the development and commercialization of point-of-care combination tests capable of detecting markers of infection present during different stages of infection (viral nonstructural protein 1 and immunoglobulin M) has greatly simplified laboratory-based dengue diagnosis. Despite these advances, significant challenges remain in the clinical management of dengue-infected patients, especially in the absence of reliable biomarkers that provide an effective prognostic indicator of severe disease progression. This review briefly summarizes some of the complexities and issues surrounding clinical dengue diagnosis and the laboratory diagnostic options currently available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Muller","given":"David A."},{"family":"Depelsenaire","given":"Alexandra C.

  {"id":"murray2006","abstract":"This chapter describes the impact of formal intellectual property rights on the production and diffusion of \"dual knowledge\"-ideas that are simultaneously of value as a scientific discovery and as a useful, inventive construct. We argue that a great deal of knowledge generated in academia, particularly in the life sciences, falls into this category (sometimes referred to as Pasteur's Quadrant). The production and diffusion of dual purpose knowledge challenges the premise of most science policy analysis, which is implicitly based on a clear separation between basic scientific knowledge and applied knowledge useful in the development of new technology. Instead, dual knowledge simultaneously makes both a basic and an applied contribution. We review qualitative and quantitative evidence relating to the policy challenges raised by the production and dissemination of dual knowledge, highlighting three broad findings. First, rather than facing a fundamental tradeoff between applied research and more fundamental scientific knowledge, research agencies can and do invest in dual purpose knowledge. Indeed, the dual purpose knowledge framework suggests a distinct rationale for public sector involvement in the funding and conduct of research: the social impact of a given piece of knowledge may be enhanced when knowledge is produced and disclosed in accordance with the norms of the scientific research community (particularly compared to secrecy). Second, we suggest that, within Pasteur's Quadrant, the increased use of formal IPR seems to be significantly shaping the structure, conduct and performance of both university and industry researchers. On the one hand, from the perspective of individual researchers, patenting does not seem to come at the expense of scientific publication, and both respond to the process of scientific discovery. There is some evidence, however, that patent grant may reduce the extent of use of knowledge: the citation rate to a scientific article describing a dual-purpose discovery experiences a modest decline after patent rights are granted over that knowledge. Finally, the impact of patents may be indirect; rather than directly impacting behavior through patent enforcement, scientific conduct may be affected through related mechanisms such as material transfer agreements. Not simply a legal document within a seamless web of cooperation, nor a bludgeon to stop scientific progress in its tracks, patents seem to be changing the \"rules of the game\" for scientific exchange, cooperation, and credit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Murray","given":"Fiona"},{"family":"Stern","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"murray2006","container-title":"Innovation Policy and the Economy","DOI":"10.1086/ipe.7.25056189","ISSN":"1531-3468","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",1]]},"page":"33-69","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"When Ideas Are Not Free: The Impact of Patents on Scientific Research","title-short":"When Ideas Are Not Free","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/ipe.7.25056189","volume":"7"},

At the molecular level, this disease is characterized by the formation of aberrant intracellular protein deposits known as Lewy bodies. Oligomeric forms of the protein α-synuclein (αS), which are believed to be both intermediates and by-products of Lewy body formation, are considered to be the main pathogenic species. Interactions of such oligomers with lipid membranes are increasingly emerging as a major molecular pathway underpinning their toxicity. Here we review recent progress in our understanding of the interactions of αS oligomers with lipid membranes. We highlight key structural and biophysical features of αS oligomers, the effects of these features on αS oligomer membrane binding properties, and resultant implications for understanding the etiology of Parkinson's disease. We discuss mechanistic modes of αS oligomer–lipid membrane interactions and the effects of environmental factors to such modes.

Besides corrosion protection, the corrosion prediction of the canister is also important. Advanced knowledge of the corrosion rate of spent nuclear fuel canister material in a particular environment can be extremely helpful in choosing the best protection method. Applying machine learning (ML) to corrosion rate prediction solves all the challenges because of the number of variables affecting soil corrosion. In this study, several algorithms of ML, including series individual, boosting, bagging artificial neural network (ANN), series individual, boosting, bagging Chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) tree decision, linear regression (LR) and an ensemble learning (EL) merge the best option that collects from 3 algorithm methods above. From the performance of each model to find the model with the highest accuracy is the ensemble stacking method. Mean absolute error performance matrices are shown in Fig. 15.

These coordinates drive an adaptive system comprising two galvanometric mirrors (x,y, transverse directions) and a tunable lens (z, longitudinal) which redirect light scattered from the corresponding region of space towards the confocal entrance of a spectrometer, thus allowing long spectral investigations on individual, freely-moving particles.

  {"id":"nguyen2023","abstract":"This study reports on the development of a new concept of on-line dual preconcentration stages for capillary electrophoresis (CE), in which two completely different preconcentration approaches can be realized in the same capillary. In the first stage, a dynamic magneto-extraction of target analytes on circulating magnetic beads is implemented within the capillary. In the second one, electrokinetic preconcentration of eluted analytes via large volume sample stacking is carried out to focus them into a nano band, prior to CE separation of enriched analytes. To implement the dual-stage preconcentration operation, a purpose-made instrument was designed, combining electrophoretic and microfluidic modules to allow precise control of the movement of magnetic beads and analyte's flow. The potential of this new enrichment principle and its associated instrument was demonstrated for CE separation with light-emitting-diode-induced fluorescent (LEDIF) detection of target double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA). The workflow consists of purification and preconcentration of a target DNA fragment (300 bp) on negatively charged magnetic beads, followed by in-capillary elution and fluorescent labelling of the enriched DNA. Large volume sample stacking of the DNA eluent was then triggered to further preconcentrate the labelled DNA before its analysis by CE-LEDIF. An enrichment factor of 125 was achieved for the target DNA fragment. With our new approach, dual-stage sample pretreatment and CE separation can now be performed in-capillary without any mismatch of working volumes, nor any waste of pretreated samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Ngoc Van Thanh"},{"family":"Smadja","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Taverna","given":"Myriam"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Lac Thuy Huu"},{"family":"Descroix","given":"Stéphanie"},{"family":"Mai","given":"Thanh Duc"}],"citation-key":"nguyen2023","container-title":"Analytica Chimica Acta","container-title-short":"Analytica Chimica Acta","DOI":"10.1016/j.aca.2023.341141","ISSN":"0003-2670","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,15]]},"page":"341141","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On-line dual-stage enrichment via magneto-extraction and electrokinetic preconcentration: A new concept and instrumentation for capillary electrophoresis","title-short":"On-line dual-stage enrichment via magneto-extraction and electrokinetic preconcentration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267023003628","volume":"1255"},

  {"id":"nicoletti1991","abstract":"Abstract   Corticosteroids, calcium ionophores and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies kill mouse thymocytes incubated in vitro. Cell death is preceded by extensive DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosomal subunits. This type of cell death (apoptosis), which physiologically occurs in the intrathymic process of immune cell selection, is usually evaluated by either electrophoretic or colorimetric methods which measure DNA fragmentation in the nuclear extracts. These techniques are unable to determine the percentage of apopotic nuclei or recognize the apoptotic cells in a heterogeneous cell population.  We have developed a flow cytometric method for measuring the percentage of apoptotic nuclei after propidium iodide staining in hypotonic buffer and have compared it with the classical colorimetric and electrophoretic techniques using dexamethasone (DEX)-treated mouse thymocytes.  Apoptotic nuclei appeared as a broad hypodiploid DNA peak which was easily discriminable from the narrow peak of thymocytes with normal (diploid) DNA content in the red fluorescence channels. When the DEX-induced apoptosis was inhibited by either low-temperature (4°C) incubation or cycloheximide treatment, no hypodiploid DNA peak appeared. Similarly, thymocyte death induced by sodium azide, a substance with cell-killing activity through non-apoptotic mechanisms, did not result in any variation in the normal DNA peak. The flow cytometric data showed an excellent correlation with the results obtained with both electrophoretic and colorimetric methods.  This new rapid, simple and reproducible method should prove useful for assessing apoptosis of specific cell populations in heterogeneous tissues such as bone marrow, thymus and lymph nodes.","author":[{"family":"Nicoletti","given":"Ildo"},{"family":"Migliorati","given":"Graziella"},{"family":"Pagliacci","given":"M.

From the thousands of papers now published on EVs annually, one easily gets the impression that EVs provide biomarkers for all diseases, and that EVs are carriers of all relevant biomolecules and are omnipotent therapeutics. At the same time, EVs are heterogeneous, elusive and difficult to study due to their physical properties and the complex composition of their environment. This overview addresses the current challenges encountered when working with EVs, and how we envision that most of these challenges will be overcome in the near future. Right now, an infrastructure is being developed to improve the reproducibility of EV measurement results. This infrastructure comprises expert task forces of the International Society of Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) developing guidelines and recommendations, instrument calibration, standardized and transparent reporting, and education.

  {"id":"noh2020","abstract":"Identifying promising technologies using patents has long been a popular topic in the technology forecasting field. In relevant studies, promising technology has been defined as patents having significant impacts on subsequent patents; thus, such patents were identified based on their expected citation frequencies. However, within the paradigm of open innovation, various perspectives, such as commercial and technological impacts, need to be considered in assessing promising technology. Therefore, this study aims to investigate patent information that can be used to assess a patent's potential as a promising technology in terms of three criteria: technological impact, standardization, and licensing. Here, the focus was on ex ante information, a set of information provided at the point of application, on which seven indicators showing the invention characteristics were designed. Then, the telecommunications sector was selected as the target industry, and we collected data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The research findings are expected to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on patent analysis by offering a broader view of promising patents. Practically, these findings can suggest valuable implications for decision makers in charge of R&D planning in the telecommunications sector within the paradigm of open innovation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Noh","given":"Heeyong"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Sungjoo"}],"citation-key":"noh2020","container-title":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","container-title-short":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","DOI":"10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120046","ISSN":"0040-1625","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"page":"120046","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What constitutes a promising technology in the era of open innovation?

UV transparent integrated waveguides launch light at a wavelength of 254 nm from a mercury lamp along the length of a 1-mm long detection cell. Transmitted UV light is collected by another waveguide in the opposite end of the detection cell, while visible fluorescence is collected vertically through the lid of the chip. The background of scattered excitation light is suppressed by detection perpendicular to the excitation, the limited UV transparency of the borosilicate lid and by choosing a PMT insensitive to the excitation light. This way, the need for a fluorescence filter is eliminated. Calibration curves were measured for serotonin, tryptophan, propranolol and acetaminophen, and separations of the four compounds were demonstrated by electrophoresis and MEKC. All compounds could be detected in the micromolar range by absorbance detection, but fluorescence detection improved detection limits for compounds displaying native UV fluorescence up to ten times. The simultaneous detection also proved useful for the identification of compounds with similar retention times and even enables accurate quantification of co-eluting compounds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Ohlsson","given":"Pelle D."},{"family":"Ordeig","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Mogensen","given":"Klaus B."},{"family":"Kutter","given":"Jörg P."}],"citation-key":"ohlsson2009","container-title":"ELECTROPHORESIS","container-title-short":"ELECTROPHORESIS","DOI":"10.1002/elps.200900393","ISSN":"1522-2683","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"4172-4178","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Electrophoresis microchip with integrated waveguides for simultaneous native UV fluorescence and absorbance detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elps.200900393/abstract","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"oliveira-ferreira2010","abstract":"Malaria is still a major public health problem in Brazil, with approximately 306 000 registered cases in 2009, but it is estimated that in the early 1940s, around six million cases of malaria occurred each year. As a result of the fight against the disease, the number of malaria cases decreased over the years and the smallest numbers of cases to-date were recorded in the 1960s. From the mid-1960s onwards, Brazil underwent a rapid and disorganized settlement process in the Amazon and this migratory movement led to a progressive increase in the number of reported cases. Although the main mosquito vector (Anopheles darlingi) is present in about 80% of the country, currently the incidence of malaria in Brazil is almost exclusively (99,8% of the cases) restricted to the region of the Amazon Basin, where a number of combined factors favors disease transmission and impair the use of standard control procedures. Plasmodium vivax accounts for 83,7% of registered cases, while Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for 16,3% and Plasmodium malariae is seldom observed. Although vivax malaria is thought to cause little mortality, compared to falciparum malaria, it accounts for much of the morbidity and for huge burdens on the prosperity of endemic communities. However, in the last few years a pattern of unusual clinical complications with fatal cases associated with P. vivax have been reported in Brazil and this is a matter of concern for Brazilian malariologists. In addition, the emergence of P. vivax strains resistant to chloroquine in some reports needs to be further investigated. In contrast, asymptomatic infection by P. falciparum and P. vivax has been detected in epidemiological studies in the states of Rondonia and Amazonas, indicating probably a pattern of clinical immunity in both autochthonous and migrant populations. Seropidemiological studies investigating the type of immune responses elicited in naturally-exposed populations to several malaria vaccine candidates in Brazilian populations have also been providing important information on whether immune responses specific to these antigens are generated in natural infections and their immunogenic potential as vaccine candidates. The present difficulties in reducing economic and social risk factors that determine the incidence of malaria in the Amazon Region render impracticable its elimination in the region. As a result, a malaria-integrated control effort - as a joint action on the part of the government and the population - directed towards the elimination or reduction of the risks of death or illness, is the direction adopted by the Brazilian government in the fight against the disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Oliveira-Ferreira","given":"Joseli"},{"family":"Lacerda","given":"Marcus VG"},{"family":"Brasil","given":"Patrícia"},{"family":"Ladislau","given":"José LB"},{"family":"Tauil","given":"Pedro L."},{"family":"Daniel-Ribeiro","given":"Cláudio Tadeu"}],"citation-key":"oliveira-ferreira2010","container-title":"Malaria Journal","container-title-short":"Malar J","DOI":"10.1186/1475-2875-9-115","ISSN":"1475-2875","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",4,30]]},"language":"en","page":"115","source":"Springer Link","title":"Malaria in Brazil: an overview","title-short":"Malaria in Brazil","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-9-115","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"ongaro2022","abstract":"Single-use, disposable, point-of-care diagnostic devices carry great promises for global health, including meeting urgent needs for testing and diagnosis in places with limited laboratory facilities. Unfortunately, the production and disposal of single-use devices, whether in lateral flow assay, cartridges, cassettes, or lab-on-chip microfluidic format, also poses significant challenges for environmental and human health. Point-of-care devices, are commonly manufactured from unsustainable polymeric materials derived from fossil sources. Their disposal often necessitates incineration to reduce infection risk, thereby creating additional release of CO2. Many devices also contain toxic chemicals, such as cyanide derivatives, that are damaging to environmental and human health if not disposed of safely. Yet, in the absence of government regulatory frameworks, safe and sustainable waste management for these novel medical devices is often left unaddressed. There is an urgent need to find novel solutions to avert environmental and human harm from these devices, especially in low- and middle-income countries where waste management infrastructure is often weak and where the use of point-of-care tests is projected to rise in coming years. We review here common materials used in the manufacture of single-use point-of-care diagnostic tests, examine the risks they pose to environmental and human health, and investigate replacement materials that can potentially reduce the impact of microfluidic devices on the production of harmful waste. We propose solutions available to point-of-care test developers to start embedding sustainability at an early stage in their design, and to reduce their non-renewable plastic consumption in research and product development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Ongaro","given":"Alfredo Edoardo"},{"family":"Ndlovu","given":"Zibusiso"},{"family":"Sollier","given":"Elodie"},{"family":"Otieno","given":"Collins"},{"family":"Ondoa","given":"Pascale"},{"family":"Street","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Kersaudy-Kerhoas","given":"Maïwenn"}],"citation-key":"ongaro2022","container-title":"Lab on a Chip","container-title-short":"Lab Chip","DOI":"10.1039/D2LC00380E","ISSN":"1473-0189","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,23]]},"language":"en","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","source":"pubs.rsc.org","title":"Engineering a sustainable future for point-of-care diagnostic and single-use microfluidic devices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/lc/d2lc00380e"},

This new method can be used to develop urinary extracellular vesicles further as a non-invasive tool for investigating human renal physiology. Abstract Exosomes are vesicles that are released from the kidney into urine. They contain protein and RNA from the glomerulus and all sections of the nephron and represent a reservoir for biomarker discovery. Current methods for the identification and quantification of urinary exosomes are time consuming and only semi-quantitative. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) counts and sizes particles by measuring their Brownian motion in solution. In this study, we applied NTA to human urine and identified particles with a range of sizes. Using antibodies against the exosomal proteins CD24 and aquaporin 2 (AQP2), conjugated to a fluorophore, we could identify a subpopulation of CD24- and AQP2-positive particles of characteristic exosomal size. Extensive pre-NTA processing of urine was not necessary. However, the intra-assay variability in the measurement of exosome concentration was significantly reduced when an ultracentrifugation step preceded NTA. Without any sample processing, NTA tracked exosomal AQP2 upregulation induced by desmopressin stimulation of kidney collecting duct cells. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was also able to track changes in exosomal AQP2 concentration that followed desmopressin treatment of mice and a patient with central diabetes insipidus. When urine was stored at room temperature, 4°C or frozen, nanoparticle concentration was reduced; freezing at −80°C with the addition of protease inhibitors produced the least reduction. In conclusion, with appropriate sample storage, NTA has potential as a tool for the characterization and quantification of extracellular vesicles in human urine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Oosthuyzen","given":"Wilna"},{"family":"Sime","given":"Nicole E.

Red blood cells (RBCs) infected with different stages of Plasmodium spp. release extracellular vesicles (EVs). Extensive studies have recently shown that these EVs are involved in key aspects of the parasite's biology and disease pathogenesis. However, they are yet to be fully characterized. The blood stages of Plasmodium spp., namely the rings, trophozoites and schizonts, are phenotypically distinct, hence, may induce the release of characteristically different EVs from infected RBCs. To gain insights into the biology and biogenesis of malaria EVs, it is important to characterize their biophysical and biochemical properties. By differential centrifugation, we isolated EVs from in vitro cultures of RBCs infected with different stages of Plasmodium falciparum. We performed a preliminary characterization of these EVs and observed that important EV markers were differentially expressed in EVs with different sedimentation properties as well as across EVs released from ring-, trophozoite- or schizont-infected RBCs. Our findings show that RBCs infected with different stages of malaria parasites release EVs with distinct protein expression profiles.","author":[{"family":"Opadokun","given":"Tosin"},{"family":"Agyapong","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Rohrbach","given":"Petra"}],"citation-key":"opadokun2022","container-title":"Membranes","container-title-short":"Membranes (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/membranes12040397","ISSN":"2077-0375","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"397","PMCID":"PMC9033066","PMID":"35448366","source":"PubMed","title":"Protein Profiling of Malaria-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Reveals Distinct Subtypes","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

The advent of single-molecule optics over the past few decades has ushered in a new era in optical imaging, partly because it has enabled the observation of motion and more recently structure on the nanoscopic scale through the development of super-resolution techniques. The large majority of these studies have relied on the efficient detection of fluorescence as the basis of single-molecule sensitivity. Despite the many advantages of using single emitters as light sources, the intensity and duration of their emission impose fundamental limits on the imaging speed and precision for tracking studies. Here, we discuss the potential of a novel imaging technique based on interferometric scattering (iSCAT) that pushes both the sensitivity and time resolution far beyond what is currently achievable by single-emitter-based approaches.

HoloNTA is applicable to any heterogeneous nanoparticle sample and has the sensitivity to measure the intrinsic heterogeneity of the sample. Specifically, we combined high dynamic range k-space imaging with holographic 3D single-particle tracking. This strategy enables long-term tracking by extending the imaging volume and delivers precise and accurate estimates of both scattering amplitude and diffusion coefficient of individual nanoparticles, from which particle refractive index and hydrodynamic size are determined. We specifically demonstrate, by simulations and experiments, that irrespective of localization uncertainty and size, the sizing sensitivity is improved as our extended detection volume yields considerably longer particle trajectories than previously reported by comparable technologies. As validation, we measured both homogeneous and heterogeneous suspensions of nanoparticles in the 40–250 nm size range and further monitored protein corona formation, where we identified subtle differences between the nanoparticle–protein complexes derived from avidin, bovine serum albumin, and streptavidin. We foresee that our approach will find many applications of both fundamental and applied nature where routine quantification and sizing of nanoparticles are required.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ortiz-Orruño","given":"Unai"},{"family":"Quidant","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Hulst","given":"Niek F.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Liebel","given":"Matz"},{"family":"Ortega Arroyo","given":"Jaime"}],"citation-key":"ortiz-orruno2023","container-title":"ACS Nano","container-title-short":"ACS Nano","DOI":"10.1021/acsnano.2c06883","ISSN":"1936-0851","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,10]]},"note":"10 citations (Crossref) [2024-05-24]","page":"221-229","publisher":"American Chemical Society","source":"ACS Publications","title":"Simultaneous Sizing and Refractive Index Analysis of Heterogeneous Nanoparticle Suspensions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.2c06883","volume":"17"},

Obtaining better fibers for the short-wavelength range has been restricted, in all fiber optics, by scattering processes. In hollow-core fibers, the scattering loss arises from the core roughness and represents the limiting factor for loss reduction regardless of the cladding confinement power. Here, we report on the reduction of the core surface roughness of hollow-core fibers by modifying their fabrication technique. The effect of the modified process has been quantified and the results showed a root-mean-square surface roughness reduction from 0.40 to 0.15 nm. The improvement in the core surface entailed fibers with ultralow loss at short wavelengths. The results reveal this approach as a promising path for the development of hollow-core fibers with loss that can potentially be orders of magnitude lower than the ones achievable with silica-core counterparts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Osório","given":"Jonas H."},{"family":"Amrani","given":"Foued"},{"family":"Delahaye","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Dhaybi","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Vasko","given":"Kostiantyn"},{"family":"Melli","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Giovanardi","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Vandembroucq","given":"Damien"},{"family":"Tessier","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Vincetti","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Debord","given":"Benoît"},{"family":"Gérôme","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Benabid","given":"Fetah"}],"citation-key":"osorio2023","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-023-36785-6","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,28]]},"language":"en","page":"1146","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hollow-core fibers with reduced surface roughness and ultralow loss in the short-wavelength range","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36785-6","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"ou2021","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a class of cell-derived lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles secreted by almost all mammalian cells and involved in intercellular communication by shuttling various biological cargoes. Over the last decade, EVs – namely exosomes and microvesicles – have been extensively explored as next-generation nanoscale drug delivery systems (DDSs). This is in large due to their endogenous origin, which enables EVs to circumvent some of the limitations associated with existing cancer therapy approaches (i.e. by preventing recognition by the immune system and improving selectivity towards tumor tissue). However, successful translation of these cell-derived vesicles into clinical applications has been hindered by several factors, among which the loading of exogenous therapeutic molecules still represents a great challenge. In order to address this issue and to further advance these biologically-derived systems as drug carriers, EV-biohybrid nano-DDSs, obtained through the fusion of EVs with conventional synthetic nano-DDSs, have recently been proposed as a valuable alternative as DDSs. Building on the idea of “combining the best of both worlds”, a combination of these two unique entities aims to harness the beneficial properties associated with both EVs and conventional nano-DDSs, while overcoming the flaws of the individual components. These biohybrid systems also provide a unique opportunity for exploitation of new synergisms, often leading to improved therapeutic outcomes, thus paving the way for advancements in cancer therapy. This review aims to describe the recent developments of EV-biohybrid nano-DDSs in cancer therapy, to highlight the most promising results and breakthroughs, as well as to provide a glimpse on the possible intrinsic targeting mechanisms of EVs that can be bequeathed to their hybrid systems. Finally, we also provide some insights in the future perspectives of EV-hybrid DDSs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Ou","given":"Yi-Hsuan"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Czarny","given":"Bertrand"},{"family":"Wacker","given":"Matthias G."},{"family":"Yu","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiong-Wei"},{"family":"Pastorin","given":"Giorgia"}],"citation-key":"ou2021","collection-title":"Extracellular vesicles in cancer, from signaling mechanisms to therapeutic potentials","container-title":"Seminars in Cancer Biology","container-title-short":"Seminars in Cancer Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.semcancer.2021.02.006","ISSN":"1044-579X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"45-61","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Extracellular Vesicle (EV) biohybrid systems for cancer therapy: Recent advances and future perspectives","title-short":"Extracellular Vesicle (EV) biohybrid systems for cancer therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X21000298","volume":"74"},

  {"id":"pandya2022","abstract":"Transition metal oxides are state-of-the-art materials for catalysing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whose slow kinetics currently limit the efficiency of water electrolysis. However, microscale physicochemical heterogeneity between particles, dynamic reactions both in the bulk and at the surface, and an interplay between particle reactivity and electrolyte makes probing the OER challenging. Here, we overcome these limitations by applying state-of-the-art compressive Raman imaging to uncover competing bias-dependent mechanisms for the OER in a solid electrocatalyst, {\\alpha}-Li2IrO3. By spatially and temporally tracking changes in the in- and out-of-plane Ir-O stretching modes - identified by density functional theory calculations - we follow catalytic activation and charge accumulation following ion exchange under a variety of electrolytes, particle compositions and cycling conditions. We extract velocities of phase fronts and demonstrate that at low overpotentials oxygen is evolved by the combination of an electrochemical-chemical mechanism and a classical electrocatalytic adsorbate mechanism, whereas at high overpotentials only the latter occurs. These results provide strategies to promote mechanisms for enhanced OER performances, and highlight the power of compressive Raman imaging for low-cost, chemically specific tracking of microscale reaction dynamics in a broad range of systems where ion and electron exchange can be coupled to structural changes, i.e. catalysts, battery materials, memristors, etc.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Pandya","given":"Raj"},{"family":"Dorchies","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Romanin","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Gigan","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Chin","given":"Alex W."},{"family":"Aguiar","given":"Hilton B.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Grimaud","given":"Alexis"}],"citation-key":"pandya2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2211.05818","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,10]]},"number":"arXiv:2211.05818","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Competing oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms revealed by high-speed compressive Raman imaging","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05818"},

Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields10,11. Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six decades, using data on 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents from six large-scale datasets, together with a new quantitative metric—the CD index12—that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics1,13–17. Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the ‘shoulders of giants’ view. We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science, citation practices or field-specific factors.

  {"id":"parlato2017","abstract":"Immunotherapy efficacy relies on the crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment between cancer and dendritic cells (DCs) resulting in the induction of a potent and effective antitumor response. DCs have the specific role of recognizing cancer cells, taking up tumor antigens (Ags) and then migrating to lymph nodes for Ag (cross)-presentation to naïve T cells. Interferon-α-conditioned DCs (IFN-DCs) exhibit marked phagocytic activity and the special ability of inducing Ag-specific T-cell response. Here, we have developed a novel microfluidic platform recreating tightly interconnected cancer and immune systems with specific 3D environmental properties, for tracking human DC behaviour toward tumor cells. By combining our microfluidic platform with advanced microscopy and a revised cell tracking analysis algorithm, it was possible to evaluate the guided efficient motion of IFN-DCs toward drug-treated cancer cells and the succeeding phagocytosis events. Overall, this platform allowed the dissection of IFN-DC-cancer cell interactions within 3D tumor spaces, with the discovery of major underlying factors such as CXCR4 involvement and underscored its potential as an innovative tool to assess the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Parlato","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"De Ninno","given":"Adele"},{"family":"Molfetta","given":"Rosa"},{"family":"Toschi","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Salerno","given":"Debora"},{"family":"Mencattini","given":"Arianna"},{"family":"Romagnoli","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Fragale","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Roccazzello","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Buoncervello","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Canini","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Bentivegna","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Falchi","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Bertani","given":"Francesca Romana"},{"family":"Gerardino","given":"Annamaria"},{"family":"Martinelli","given":"Eugenio"},{"family":"Natale","given":"Corrado"},{"family":"Paolini","given":"Rossella"},{"family":"Businaro","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Gabriele","given":"Lucia"}],"citation-key":"parlato2017","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-017-01013-x","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,24]]},"language":"en","license":"2017 The Author(s)","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Cell biology;Tumour immunology\nSubject_term_id: cell-biology;tumour-immunology","number":"1","page":"1093","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"3D Microfluidic model for evaluating immunotherapy efficacy by tracking dendritic cell behaviour toward tumor cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-01013-x","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"patel2018","abstract":"For many protein therapeutics including monoclonal antibodies, aggregate removal process can be complex and challenging. We evaluated two different process analytical technology (PAT) applications that couple a purification unit performing preparative hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) to a multi-angle light scattering (MALS) system. Using first principle measurements, the MALS detector calculates weight-average molar mass, Mw and can control aggregate levels in purification. The first application uses an in-line MALS to send start/stop fractionation trigger signals directly to the purification unit when preset Mw criteria are met or unmet. This occurs in real-time and eliminates the need for analysis after purification. The second application uses on-line ultra-high performance size-exclusion liquid chromatography to sample from the purification stream, separating the mAb species and confirming their Mw using a µMALS detector. The percent dimer (1.5%) determined by the on-line method is in agreement with the data from the in-line application (Mw increase of approximately 2750 Da). The novel HIC-MALS systems demonstrated here can be used as a powerful tool for real-time aggregate monitoring and control during biologics purification enabling future real time release of biotherapeutics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Patel","given":"Bhumit A."},{"family":"Gospodarek","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Larkin","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Kenrick","given":"Sophia A."},{"family":"Haverick","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Tugcu","given":"Nihal"},{"family":"Brower","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Douglas D."}],"citation-key":"patel2018","container-title":"mAbs","container-title-short":"MAbs","DOI":"10.1080/19420862.2018.1505178","ISSN":"1942-0862","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,19]]},"note":"20 citations (Crossref) [2024-05-31]","page":"945-950","PMCID":"PMC6204791","PMID":"30130442","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Multi-angle light scattering as a process analytical technology measuring real-time molecular weight for downstream process control","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204791/","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"pearce2015","abstract":"With the maturation of digital manufacturing technologies like 3-D printing, a new paradigm is emerging of distributed manufacturing in both scientific equipment and consumer goods. Hardware released under free licenses is known as free and open source hardware (FOSH). The availability of these FOSH designs has a large value to those with access to digital manufacturing methods and particularly for scientists with needs for highly-customized low-volume production products. It is challenging to use traditional funding models to support the necessary investment of resources in FOSH development because of the difficulty in quantifying the value of the result. In order to overcome that challenge and harvest the current opportunity in both low-cost scientific equipment and consumer products, this article evaluates the following methods to quantify the value of FOSH design including: 1) downloaded substitution valuation; 2) avoided reproduction valuation and 3) market savings valuation along with additional benefits related to market expansion, scientific innovation acceleration, educational enhancement and medical care improvement. The strengths and weaknesses of these methods are analyzed and the results show that the methods are relatively straight-forward to institute, based on reliable freely-available data, and that they minimize assumptions. A case study of a syringe pump with numerous scientific and medical applications is presented. The results found millions of dollars of economic value from a relatively simple scientific device being released under open-licenses representing orders of magnitude increase in value from conventional proprietary development. The inescapable conclusion of this study is that FOSH development should be funded by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments particularly in technologies associated with science, medicine and education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearce","given":"Joshua M."}],"citation-key":"pearce2015","container-title":"Modern Economy","DOI":"10.4236/me.2015.61001","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,12]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","number":"1","page":"1-11","publisher":"Scientific Research Publishing","source":"scirp.org","title":"Quantifying the Value of Open Source Hard-ware Development","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.scirp.org/Journal/Paperabs.aspx?paperid=53076","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"pearce2020","abstract":"Both the free and open source software (FOSS) as well as the distributed digital manufacturing of free and open source hardware (FOSH) has shown particular promise among scientists for developing custom scientific tools. Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87% compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89% for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92% for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94% for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH. Policies were outlined that provide nations with a template for strategically harvesting the opportunities provided by the free and open source paradigm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearce","given":"Joshua M."}],"citation-key":"pearce2020","container-title":"HardwareX","container-title-short":"HardwareX","DOI":"10.1016/j.ohx.2020.e00139","ISSN":"2468-0672","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e00139","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Economic savings for scientific free and open source technology: A review","title-short":"Economic savings for scientific free and open source technology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067220300481","volume":"8"},

The intrinsic capacity of extracellular vesicles to encapsulate macromolecules within their lipid bilayer membrane-bound lumen is a characteristic exploited in drug delivery to transport active pharmaceutical ingredients. Besides their role as biological nanocarriers, extracellular vesicles have a specific tropism towards target cells, which is a key aspect in precision medicine. However, the little knowledge of the mechanisms governing the release of a cargo macromolecule in recipient cells and the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade scale-up manufacturing of extracellular vesicles are currently slowing their application as drug delivery nanocarriers. In this review, we summarize, from a cell biologist’s perspective, the main evidence supporting the role of extracellular vesicles as promising carriers in drug delivery, and we report five key considerations that merit further investigation before translating Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) to clinical applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pedrioli","given":"Giona"},{"family":"Piovesana","given":"Ester"},{"family":"Vacchi","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Balbi","given":"Carolina"}],"citation-key":"pedrioli2021","container-title":"Biology","DOI":"10.3390/biology10050376","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"5","page":"376","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Extracellular Vesicles as Promising Carriers in Drug Delivery: Considerations from a Cell Biologist’s Perspective","title-short":"Extracellular Vesicles as Promising Carriers in Drug Delivery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/10/5/376","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"pedulla2020","abstract":"A Stanford and Harvard professor convened a symposium on what’s actually working to improve diversity and inclusion in organizational life. In this article, David Pedulla summarizes the main findings. First, organizations should set goals, collect data, and hold people accountable for improving diversity within the organization. Second, organizations should abandon traditional discrimination and harassment reporting systems—these often lead to retaliation. Employee Assistance Plans (EAPs), ombuds offices, and transformative dispute resolution systems can not only play a critical role in reducing retaliation but also provide fuel for organizational change. Third, organizations should check to ensure that technologies used to assist in hiring and promotion aren’t inherently biased. Fourth, companies must avoid tokenism. Finally, organizations should get managers and other leaders involved in diversity programs from the start. This will increase buy-in and lead to smooth implementation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Pedulla","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"pedulla2020","container-title":"Harvard Business Review","ISSN":"0017-8012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,12]]},"section":"Diversity and inclusion","source":"hbr.org","title":"Diversity and Inclusion Efforts That Really Work","type":"article-magazine","URL":"https://hbr.org/2020/05/diversity-and-inclusion-efforts-that-really-work"},
  {"id":"pegtel2010","abstract":"Noncoding regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) of cellular and viral origin control gene expression by repressing the translation of mRNAs into protein. Interestingly, miRNAs are secreted actively through small vesicles called “exosomes” that protect them from degradation by RNases, suggesting that these miRNAs may function outside the cell in which they were produced. Here we demonstrate that miRNAs secreted by EBV-infected cells are transferred to and act in uninfected recipient cells. Using a quantitative RT-PCR approach, we demonstrate that mature EBV-encoded miRNAs are secreted by EBV-infected B cells through exosomes. These EBV-miRNAs are functional because internalization of exosomes by MoDC results in a dose-dependent, miRNA-mediated repression of confirmed EBV target genes, including CXCL11/ITAC, an immunoregulatory gene down-regulated in primary EBV-associated lymphomas. We demonstrate that throughout coculture of EBV-infected B cells EBV-miRNAs accumulate in noninfected neighboring MoDC and show that this accumulation is mediated by transfer of exosomes. Thus, the exogenous EBV-miRNAs transferred through exosomes are delivered to subcellular sites of gene repression in recipient cells. Finally, we show in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with increased EBV load that, although EBV DNA is restricted to the circulating B-cell population, EBV BART miRNAs are present in both B-cell and non-B-cell fractions, suggestive of miRNA transfer. Taken together our findings are consistent with miRNA-mediated gene silencing as a potential mechanism of intercellular communication between cells of the immune system that may be exploited by the persistent human γ-herpesvirus EBV.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pegtel","given":"D.

Exosomes contain an array of membrane-associated, high-order oligomeric protein complexes, display pronounced molecular heterogeneity, and are created by budding at both plasma and endosome membranes. Exosome biogenesis is a mechanism of protein quality control, and once released, exosomes have activities as diverse as remodeling the extracellular matrix and transmitting signals and molecules to other cells. This pathway of intercellular vesicle traffic plays important roles in many aspects of human health and disease, including development, immunity, tissue homeostasis, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, viruses co-opt exosome biogenesis pathways both for assembling infectious particles and for establishing host permissiveness. On the basis of these and other properties, exosomes are being developed as therapeutic agents in multiple disease models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pegtel","given":"D.

  {"id":"peruzzotti-jametti2021","abstract":"Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation induces recovery in animal models of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Although the replacement of lost endogenous cells was originally proposed as the primary healing mechanism of NSC grafts, it is now clear that transplanted NSCs operate via multiple mechanisms, including the horizontal exchange of therapeutic cargoes to host cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are membrane particles trafficking nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites and metabolic enzymes, lipids, and entire organelles. However, the function and the contribution of these cargoes to the broad therapeutic effects of NSCs are yet to be fully understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an established feature of several inflammatory and degenerative CNS disorders, most of which are potentially treatable with exogenous stem cell therapeutics. Herein, we investigated the hypothesis that NSCs release and traffic functional mitochondria via EVs to restore mitochondrial function in target cells. Untargeted proteomics revealed a significant enrichment of mitochondrial proteins spontaneously released by NSCs in EVs. Morphological and functional analyses confirmed the presence of ultrastructurally intact mitochondria within EVs with conserved membrane potential and respiration. We found that the transfer of these mitochondria from EVs to mtDNA-deficient L929 Rho0 cells rescued mitochondrial function and increased Rho0 cell survival. Furthermore, the incorporation of mitochondria from EVs into inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes restored normal mitochondrial dynamics and cellular metabolism and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in target cells. When transplanted in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, exogenous NSCs actively transferred mitochondria to mononuclear phagocytes and induced a significant amelioration of clinical deficits. Our data provide the first evidence that NSCs deliver functional mitochondria to target cells via EVs, paving the way for the development of novel (a)cellular approaches aimed at restoring mitochondrial dysfunction not only in multiple sclerosis, but also in degenerative neurological diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Peruzzotti-Jametti","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Bernstock","given":"Joshua D."},{"family":"Willis","given":"Cory M."},{"family":"Manferrari","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Rogall","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Fernandez-Vizarra","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Williamson","given":"James C."},{"family":"Braga","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Bosch","given":"Aletta","dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Leonardi","given":"Tommaso"},{"family":"Krzak","given":"Grzegorz"},{"family":"Kittel","given":"Ágnes"},{"family":"Benincá","given":"Cristiane"},{"family":"Vicario","given":"Nunzio"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Sisareuth"},{"family":"Bastos","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Bicci","given":"Iacopo"},{"family":"Iraci","given":"Nunzio"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Jayden A."},{"family":"Peacock","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Muller","given":"Karin H."},{"family":"Lehner","given":"Paul J."},{"family":"Buzas","given":"Edit Iren"},{"family":"Faria","given":"Nuno"},{"family":"Zeviani","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Frezza","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Brisson","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Matheson","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Viscomi","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Pluchino","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"peruzzotti-jametti2021","container-title":"PLOS Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.3001166","ISSN":"1545-7885","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,7]]},"language":"en","page":"e3001166","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Neural stem cells traffic functional mitochondria via extracellular vesicles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001166","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"pfaff2021","abstract":"We have developed a microscope with a spatial resolution of 5 μm, which can be used to image the two-dimensional surface optical reflectance (2D-SOR) of polycrystalline samples in operando conditions. Within the field of surface science, operando tools that give information about the surface structure or chemistry of a sample under realistic experimental conditions have proven to be very valuable to understand the intrinsic reaction mechanisms in thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and corrosion science. To study heterogeneous surfaces in situ, the experimental technique must both have spatial resolution and be able to probe through gas or electrolyte. Traditional electron-based surface science techniques are difficult to use under high gas pressure conditions or in an electrolyte due to the short mean free path of electrons. Since it uses visible light, SOR can easily be used under high gas pressure conditions and in the presence of an electrolyte. In this work, we use SOR in combination with a light microscope to gain information about the surface under realistic experimental conditions. We demonstrate this by studying the different grains of three polycrystalline samples: Pd during CO oxidation, Au in electrocatalysis, and duplex stainless steel in corrosion. Optical light-based techniques such as SOR could prove to be a good alternative or addition to more complicated techniques in improving our understanding of complex polycrystalline surfaces with operando measurements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pfaff","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Larsson","given":"Alfred"},{"family":"Orlov","given":"Dmytro"},{"family":"Harlow","given":"Gary S."},{"family":"Abbondanza","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Linpé","given":"Weronica"},{"family":"Rämisch","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Gericke","given":"Sabrina M."},{"family":"Zetterberg","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Lundgren","given":"Edvin"}],"citation-key":"pfaff2021","container-title":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","container-title-short":"ACS Appl.

The book is based on a set of lecture notes that the authors used for an undergraduate course at the University of Utrecht, Netherland. It aims to provide more than a simplified qualitative description of the subject, without getting bogged down in difficult mathematics. Each chapter contains exercises, ranging from straightforward ones to more involved problems, addressing instances from (thermal motion in) chemistry, physics and life sciences. Exercises also deal with derivations or calculations that are skipped in the main text.

Few studies have attempted to qualitatively characterize citizen science engagement across multiple projects and from the perspective of the participants. Building on pertinent literature and sociocultural learning theories, this study operationalizes engagement in citizen science through an analysis of interviews of 72 participants from six different environmentally based projects. We document engagement in citizen science through an examination of cognitive, affective, social, behavioral, and motivational dimensions. We assert that engagement in citizen science is enhanced by acknowledging these multiple dimensions and creating opportunities for volunteers to find personal relevance in their work with scientists.

  {"id":"piffoux2022","abstract":"The clinical interest around extracellular vesicles (EVs) started during the year 2000s, now leading to new clinical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Due to their outstanding properties as biogenic drug delivery systems and as alternatives to cell therapy, the need to produce EVs with sufficiently high yield and quality for clinical use expedited the development of analytical techniques and dedicated bioproduction methods. Though preclinical studies revealed the potential of EVs to become next generation subcellular therapies that could lead to major breakthroughs in current therapeutics possibilities, they remain complex objects on both a physicochemical and biological level. Here, we review the capacity of microfluidic technologies to match EV-based therapeutics need for clinical translation via standardized and intensified bioproduction methods. Indeed, some of the current routine tools used in bioproduction are already achieved on chips such as micromixers or particle sorting and analysis using field flow fraction or nanoparticle tracking analyzer. Also, microfluidics communities have developed a wide set of new techniques to isolate and quantify EVs, but the few that are adopted in a bioproduction workflow are well-established since the 1990s. We first review the different EV generation and loading methods embedded on chip. We focus on EVs preparation methods, from purification to in-line separative techniques. We finally describe the on-chip analytical tools to analyze physicochemistry and phenotypes of EVs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Piffoux","given":"Max"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Amanda K.

Unlike popular wide-field and confocal methods, plane-illumination microscopy limits excitation to the information-rich vicinity of the focal plane, providing effective optical sectioning and high speed while minimizing out-of-focus background and premature photobleaching. Here we used scanned Bessel beams in conjunction with structured illumination and/or two-photon excitation to create thinner light sheets (<0.5 μm) better suited to three-dimensional (3D) subcellular imaging. As demonstrated by imaging the dynamics of mitochondria, filopodia, membrane ruffles, intracellular vesicles and mitotic chromosomes in live cells, the microscope currently offers 3D isotropic resolution down to ~0.3 μm, speeds up to nearly 200 image planes per second and the ability to noninvasively acquire hundreds of 3D data volumes from single living cells encompassing tens of thousands of image frames.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Planchon","given":"Thomas A"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Milkie","given":"Daniel E"},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Michael W"},{"family":"Galbraith","given":"James A"},{"family":"Galbraith","given":"Catherine G"},{"family":"Betzig","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"planchon2011","container-title":"Nature methods","container-title-short":"Nat Methods","DOI":"10.1038/nmeth.1586","ISSN":"1548-7091","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",5]]},"page":"417-423","PMCID":"PMC3626440","PMID":"21378978","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Rapid three-dimensional isotropic imaging of living cells using Bessel beam plane illumination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3626440/","volume":"8"},

These detection methods include flow cytometry, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and single particle reflective image sensing. To standardize measurements and enable orthogonal comparisons between platforms, a quantifiable limit of detection is required. The main parameters that dictate the amount of light scattered by particles include size, morphology, and refractive index. To date, there has been a lack of accessible techniques for measuring the refractive index of nanoparticles at a single-particle level. Here, we demonstrate two methods of deriving a small particle refractive index using orthogonal measurements with commercially available platforms. These methods can be applied at either a single-particle or population level, enabling the integration of diameter and scattering cross section values to derive the refractive index using Mie theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Pleet","given":"Michelle L."},{"family":"Cook","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Vera A."},{"family":"Stack","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Ford","given":"Verity J."},{"family":"Lannigan","given":"Joanne"},{"family":"Do","given":"Ngoc"},{"family":"Wenger","given":"Ellie"},{"family":"Fraikin","given":"Jean-Luc"},{"family":"Jacobson","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Jennifer C."},{"family":"Welsh","given":"Joshua A."}],"citation-key":"pleet2023","container-title":"Nano Letters","container-title-short":"Nano Lett.","DOI":"10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c00562","ISSN":"1530-6984","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,3]]},"publisher":"American Chemical Society","source":"ACS Publications","title":"Extracellular Vesicle Refractive Index Derivation Utilizing Orthogonal Characterization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c00562"},
  {"id":"pol2014","abstract":"Background Enumeration of extracellular vesicles has clinical potential as a biomarker for disease. In biological samples, the smallest and largest vesicles typically differ 25-fold in size, 300 000-fold in concentration, 20 000-fold in volume, and 10 000 000-fold in scattered light. Because of this heterogeneity, the currently employed techniques detect concentrations ranging from 104 to 1012 vesicles mL–1. Objectives To investigate whether the large variation in the detected concentration of vesicles is caused by the minimum detectable vesicle size of five widely used techniques. Methods The size and concentration of vesicles and reference beads were measured with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a conventional flow cytometer, a flow cytometer dedicated to detecting submicrometer particles, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and resistive pulse sensing (RPS). Results Each technique gave a different size distribution and a different concentration for the same vesicle sample. Conclusion Differences between the detected vesicle concentrations are primarily caused by differences between the minimum detectable vesicle sizes. The minimum detectable vesicle sizes were 70–90 nm for NTA, 70–100 nm for RPS, 150–190 nm for dedicated flow cytometry, and 270–600 nm for conventional flow cytometry. TEM could detect the smallest vesicles present, albeit after adhesion on a surface. Dedicated flow cytometry was most accurate in determining the size of reference beads, but is expected to be less accurate on vesicles, owing to heterogeneity of the refractive index of vesicles. Nevertheless, dedicated flow cytometry is relatively fast and allows multiplex fluorescence detection, making it most applicable to clinical research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pol","given":"E.","dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Coumans","given":"F. a.

  {"id":"pradhan2022","abstract":"Viral aggregation is a complex and pervasive phenomenon affecting many viral families. An increasing number of studies have indicated that it can modulate critical parameters surrounding viral infections, and yet its role in viral infectivity, pathogenesis, and evolution is just beginning to be appreciated. Aggregation likely promotes viral infection by increasing the cellular multiplicity of infection (MOI), which can help overcome stochastic failures of viral infection and genetic defects and subsequently modulate their fitness, virulence, and host responses. Conversely, aggregation can limit the dispersal of viral particles and hinder the early stages of establishing a successful infection. The cost-benefit of viral aggregation seems to vary not only depending on the viral species and aggregating factors but also on the spatiotemporal context of the viral life cycle. Here, we review the knowns of viral aggregation by focusing on studies with direct observations of viral aggregation and mechanistic studies of the aggregation process. Next, we chart the unknowns and discuss the biological implications of viral aggregation in their infection cycle. We conclude with a perspective on harnessing the therapeutic potential of this phenomenon and highlight several challenging questions that warrant further research for this field to advance.","author":[{"family":"Pradhan","given":"Swechchha"},{"family":"Varsani","given":"Arvind"},{"family":"Leff","given":"Chloe"},{"family":"Swanson","given":"Carter J."},{"family":"Hariadi","given":"Rizal F."}],"citation-key":"pradhan2022","container-title":"Viruses","container-title-short":"Viruses","DOI":"10.3390/v14020438","ISSN":"1999-4915","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,21]]},"language":"eng","page":"438","PMCID":"PMC8879382","PMID":"35216031","source":"PubMed","title":"Viral Aggregation: The Knowns and Unknowns","title-short":"Viral Aggregation","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

The configuration termed as laser-free super-resolution microscopy (LFSM) is an extension of single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques and allows single molecules to be switched on and off (a phenomenon termed as ‘blinking’), detected and localized. The use of a short burst of deep blue excitation (350–380 nm) can be further used to reactivate the blinking, once the blinking process has slowed or stopped. A resolution of 90 nm is achieved on test specimens (mouse and amphibian meiotic chromosomes). Finally, we demonstrate that stimulated emission depletion and LFSM can be performed on the same biological sample using a simple commercial mounting medium.

Around fifty years later, the central role of humans in the extinctions is still strongly debated in North American archaeology, but little considered in South America. Here we analyze the temporal dynamic and spatial distribution of South American megafauna and fluted (Fishtail) projectile points to evaluate the role of humans in Pleistocene extinctions. We observe a strong relationship between the temporal density and spatial distribution of megafaunal species stratigraphically associated with humans and Fishtail projectile points, as well as with the fluctuations in human demography. On this basis we propose that the direct effect of human predation was the main factor driving the megafaunal decline, with other secondary, but necessary, co-occurring factors for the collapse of the megafaunal community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Prates","given":"Luciano"},{"family":"Perez","given":"S.

Numerous studies document the interest of researchers in this field of research. However, methodological issues such as the isolation of vesicles have been challenging. Remarkably, novel technologies, including those based on nanotechnology, show promise for the further development and clinical use of extracellular vesicles as liquid biomarkers. Development of biomarkers is a long and complicated process, and there are still not many biomarkers based on extracellular vesicles in clinical use. However, the knowledge acquired during the last decade constitutes a solid basis for the future development of liquid biopsy tests for prostate cancer. These are urgently needed to bring prostate cancer treatment to the next level in precision medicine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ramirez-Garrastacho","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Bajo-Santos","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Line","given":"Aija"},{"family":"Martens-Uzunova","given":"Elena S."},{"family":"Fuente","given":"Jesus Martinez","non-dropping-particle":"de la"},{"family":"Moros","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Soekmadji","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Tasken","given":"Kristin Austlid"},{"family":"Llorente","given":"Alicia"}],"citation-key":"ramirez-garrastacho2021","container-title":"British Journal of Cancer","container-title-short":"Br J Cancer","DOI":"10.1038/s41416-021-01610-8","ISSN":"1532-1827","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,22]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s)","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Reviews\nSubject_term: Biomarkers;Prostate cancer\nSubject_term_id: biomarkers;prostate-cancer","page":"1-20","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Extracellular vesicles as a source of prostate cancer biomarkers in liquid biopsies: a decade of research","title-short":"Extracellular vesicles as a source of prostate cancer biomarkers in liquid biopsies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-021-01610-8"},
  {"id":"raposo2023","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a key role both in physiological balance and homeostasis and in disease processes through their ability to participate in intercellular signaling and communication. An ever-expanding knowledge pool and a myriad of functional properties ascribed to EVs point to a new language of communication in biological systems that has opened a path for the discovery and implementation of novel diagnostic applications. EVs originate in the endosomal network and via non-random shedding from the plasma membrane by mechanisms that allow the packaging of functional cargoes, including proteins, lipids, and genetic materials. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms that govern packaging, secretion and targeted delivery of extracellular vesicle-borne cargo will be required to establish EVs as important signaling entities, especially when ascribing functional properties to a heterogeneous population of vesicles. Several molecular cascades operate within the endosomal network and at the plasma membrane that recognize and segregate cargos as a prelude to vesicle budding and release. EVs are transferred between cells and operate as vehicles in biological fluids within tissues and within the microenvironment where they are responsible for short- and long-range targeted information. In this review, we focus on the remarkable capacity of EVs to establish a dialogue between cells and within tissues, often operating in parallel to the endocrine system, we highlighting selected examples of past and recent studies on the functions of EVs in health and disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Raposo","given":"Graca"},{"family":"Stahl","given":"Philip D."}],"citation-key":"raposo2023","container-title":"Extracellular Vesicles and Circulating Nucleic Acids","container-title-short":"Extracell Vesicles Circ Nucleic Acids","DOI":"10.20517/evcna.2023.18","ISSN":"27676641","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"240-54","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Extracellular vesicles - on the cusp of a new language in the biological sciences","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://evcna.com/article/view/evcna.2023.18","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"redish","abstract":"In this chapter we describe an interactive method of teaching, Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE), that helps students learn physics by engaging in processes that mirror the activities of physicists when they construct and apply knowledge. These processes involve observing, finding patterns, building and testing explanations of the patterns, and using multiple representations to reason about physical phenomena. ISLE is a comprehensive learning system that provides a general philosophy and specific activities that can be used in “lectures” (interactive meetings where students construct and test ideas), recitations (where students learn to represent them in multiple ways while solving problems) and labs (where students learn to design their own experiments to test hypotheses and solve practical problems). In ISLE, students are assessed for conceptual understanding, for problem-solving ability, and, most importantly, for their use of various scientific abilities. We have developed activities that help students acquire some of the abilities used by scientists in their work: experiment design, model building, use of multiple-representations, evaluation, etc. To determine the degree to which the students have acquired these abilities and to simultaneously provide feedback to the students, we have developed a set of rubrics that can be used by instructors for grading and by the students for self assessment. In this chapter we also provide a theoretical basis for the ISLE structure (using brain and cognitive research), explain how this learning system addresses the needs of the 21st century science education and workplace, and how it is different from other reformed curricula.","author":[{"family":"Redish","given":"Edward"}],"citation-key":"redish","language":"en","page":"48","source":"Zotero","title":"Investigative Science Learning Environment –","type":"article-journal"},

The power of this method lies both in the wide range of cellular parameters that can be determined and in the ability to obtain information on how these parameters are distributed in the cell population. Flow cytometric assays have been developed to determine both cellular characteristics such as size, membrane potential, and intracellular pH, and the levels of cellular components such as DNA, protein, surface receptors, and calcium. Measurements that reveal the distribution of these parameters in cell populations are important for biotechnology, because they better describe the population than the average values obtained from traditional techniques.

We introduce a new technique, based on a simple piece of cardboard inserted in the objective focal plane, that enables simple 3D tracking of dilute microparticles while offering subnanometer frame-to-frame precision in all directions. Its linearity alleviates calibration procedures, while the interferometric pattern enhances precision. We illustrate its utility in single-molecule force spectroscopy and single-algae motility analysis. As with any technique based on back focal plane engineering, it may be directly embedded in a commercial objective, providing a means to convert any preexisting optical setup in a 3D tracking system. Thanks to its precision, its simplicity, and its versatility, we envision that the technique has the potential to enhance the spreading of high-precision and high-throughput 3D tracking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Rieu","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Vieille","given":"Thibault"},{"family":"Radou","given":"Gaël"},{"family":"Jeanneret","given":"Raphaël"},{"family":"Ruiz-Gutierrez","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Ducos","given":"Bertrand"},{"family":"Allemand","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Croquette","given":"Vincent"}],"citation-key":"rieu2021","container-title":"Science Advances","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.abe3902","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,5]]},"page":"eabe3902","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"science.org (Atypon)","title":"Parallel, linear, and subnanometric 3D tracking of microparticles with Stereo Darkfield Interferometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abe3902","volume":"7"},

Given the vast search space due to the variety of compositions and descriptors to be considered, and based upon existing corrosion data for MPEAs, we demonstrate descriptor optimization to predict corrosion resistance of any given MPEA. Our ML model with descriptor optimization predicts the corrosion resistance of a given MPEA in the presence of an aqueous environment by down selecting two environmental descriptors (pH of the medium and halide concentration), one chemical composition descriptor (atomic % of element with minimum reduction potential), and two atomic descriptors (difference in lattice constant ($$\\Delta {{{\\mathrm{a}}}}$$) and average reduction potential). Our findings show that, while it is possible to down select corrosion-resistant MPEAs by using ML from a large search space, a larger dataset and higher quality data are needed to accurately predict the corrosion rate of MPEAs.

  {"id":"ryvolova2012","abstract":"The requirements for early diagnostics as well as effective treatment of insidious diseases such as cancer constantly increase the pressure on development of efficient and reliable methods for targeted drug/gene delivery as well as imaging of the treatment success/failure. One of the most recent approaches covering both the drug delivery as well as the imaging aspects is benefitting from the unique properties of nanomaterials. Therefore a new field called nanomedicine is attracting continuously growing attention. Nanoparticles, including fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots) and magnetic nanoparticles, have proven their excellent properties for in vivo imaging techniques in a number of modalities such as magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging, respectively. In this article, we review the main properties and applications of nanoparticles in various in vitro imaging techniques, including microscopy and/or laser breakdown spectroscopy and in vivo methods such as magnetic resonance imaging and/or fluorescence-based imaging. Moreover the advantages of the drug delivery performed by nanocarriers such as iron oxides, gold, biodegradable polymers, dendrimers, lipid based carriers such as liposomes or micelles are also highlighted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ryvolova","given":"Marketa"},{"family":"Chomoucka","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Drbohlavova","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Kopel","given":"Pavel"},{"family":"Babula","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Hynek","given":"David"},{"family":"Adam","given":"Vojtech"},{"family":"Eckschlager","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Hubalek","given":"Jaromir"},{"family":"Stiborova","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Jozef"},{"family":"Kizek","given":"Rene"}],"citation-key":"ryvolova2012","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s121114792","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,2]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","page":"14792-14820","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Modern Micro and Nanoparticle-Based Imaging Techniques","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/12/11/14792","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"saha2012","abstract":"Detection of chemical and biological agents plays a fundamental role in biomedical, forensic and environmental sciences1–4 as well as in anti bioterrorism applications.5–7 The development of highly sensitive, cost effective, miniature sensors is therefore in high demand which requires advanced technology coupled with fundamental knowledge in chemistry, biology and material sciences.8–13\n\nIn general, sensors feature two functional components: a recognition element to provide selective/specific binding with the target analytes and a transducer component for signaling the binding event. An efficient sensor relies heavily on these two essential components for the recognition process in terms of response time, signal to noise (S/N) ratio, selectivity and limits of detection (LOD).14,15 Therefore, designing sensors with higher efficacy depends on the development of novel materials to improve both the recognition and transduction processes. Nanomaterials feature unique physicochemical properties that can be of great utility in creating new recognition and transduction processes for chemical and biological sensors15–27 as well as improving the S/N ratio by miniaturization of the sensor elements.28\n\nGold nanoparticles (AuNPs) possess distinct physical and chemical attributes that make them excellent scaffolds for the fabrication of novel chemical and biological sensors (Figure 1).29–36 First, AuNPs can be synthesized in a straightforward manner and can be made highly stable. Second, they possess unique optoelectronic properties. Third, they provide high surface-to-volume ratio with excellent biocompatibility using appropriate ligands.30 Fourth, these properties of AuNPs can be readily tuned varying their size, shape and the surrounding chemical environment. For example, the binding event between recognition element and the analyte can alter physicochemical properties of transducer AuNPs, such as plasmon resonance absorption, conductivity, redox behavior, etc. that in turn can generate a detectable response signal. Finally, AuNPs offer a suitable platform for multi-functionalization with a wide range of organic or biological ligands for the selective binding and detection of small molecules and biological targets.30–32,36 Each of these attributes of AuNPs has allowed researchers to develop novel sensing strategies with improved sensitivity, stability and selectivity. In the last decade of research, the advent of AuNP as a sensory element provided us a broad spectrum of innovative approaches for the detection of metal ions, small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, malignant cells, etc. in a rapid and efficient manner.37\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\nPhysical properties of AuNPs and schematic illustration of an AuNP-based detection system.\n\n\n\nIn this current review, we have highlighted the several synthetic routes and properties of AuNPs that make them excellent probes for different sensing strategies. Furthermore, we will discuss various sensing strategies and major advances in the last two decades of research utilizing AuNPs in the detection of variety of target analytes including metal ions, organic molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, and microorganisms.","author":[{"family":"Saha","given":"Krishnendu"},{"family":"Agasti","given":"Sarit S."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Chaekyu"},{"literal":"Xiaoning Li"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaoning"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xingde"},{"family":"Rotello","given":"Vincent M."}],"citation-key":"saha2012","container-title":"Chemical Reviews","DOI":"10.1021/cr2001178","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",5,9]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2020451212","page":"2739-2779","PMCID":"4102386","PMID":"22295941","title":"Gold nanoparticles in chemical and biological sensing.","type":"article-journal","volume":"112"},

Almost all of the bacteria in the gut secrete extracellular vesicles to assist them in competition, survival, material exchange, host immune modulation, infection, and invasion. The role of gut microbiota in the development, progression, and pathogenesis of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) cancer has been well documented. However, the possible involvement of bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEVs) in GIT cancer pathophysiology has not been given due attention. Studies have illustrated the ability of bEVs to cross physiological barriers, selectively accumulate near tumor cells, and possibly alter the tumor microenvironment (TME). A systematic search of original published works related to bacterial extracellular vesicles on gastrointestinal cancer was performed for this review. The current systemic review outlines the possible impact of gut microbiota derived bEVs in GIT cancer in light of present-day understanding. The necessity of using advanced sequencing technologies, such as genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic investigation methodologies, to facilitate an understanding of the interrelationship between cancer-associated bacterial vesicles and gastrointestinal cancer is also emphasized. We further discuss the clinical and pharmaceutical potential of bEVs, along with future efforts needed to understand the mechanism of interaction of bEVs in GIT cancer pathogenesis.","author":[{"literal":"Sajeen Bahadur Amatya"},{"literal":"Sonja Salmi"},{"family":"Kainulainen","given":"Veera"},{"family":"Karihtala","given":"Peeter"},{"literal":"Peeter Karihtala"},{"family":"Reunanen","given":"Justus"}],"citation-key":"sajeenbahaduramatya2021","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers13215450","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,29]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3208033112","page":"5450","title":"Bacterial Extracellular Vesicles in Gastrointestinal Tract Cancer: An Unexplored Territory","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

We hypothesized that (a) NETs could be promoted by platelet derived microparticles (PMPs) and (b) that 75 nm-nanofiltration of plasma, by removing parts of PMPs, could avoid NETs formation. To better characterize the large spectrum of size and concentration of PMPs in complex media, we combined conventional approaches (Flow Cytometry, TRPS) with an original nanobioanalytical (NBA) platform based on Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) techniques. We will demonstrate that this new analytic solution allows:•a label-free follow-up of PMPs capture in real time from various complex media,•a multiplex detection of different PMPs subpopulations,•the determination of the size and morphology of captured PMPs in a range of 20 nm to 1 μm their proteomic studies.

Surface–enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is an analytical technique with promising impact for the point–of–care diagnosis of viruses. It has been applied to a variety of influenza A virus subtypes, such as the H1N1 and the novel coronavirus SARS−CoV−2. In this work, a review of the strategies used for the detection of RVsZO by SERS is presented. In addition, relevant information about the SERS technique, anthropozoonosis, and RVsZO is provided for a better understanding of the theme. The direct identification is based on trapping the viruses within the interstices of plasmonic nanoparticles and recording the SERS signal from gene fragments or membrane proteins. Quantitative mono- and multiplexed assays have been achieved following an indirect format through a SERS-based sandwich immunoassay. Based on this review, the development of multiplex assays that incorporate the detection of RVsZO together with their specific biomarkers and/or secondary disease biomarkers resulting from the infection progress would be desirable. These configurations could be used as a double confirmation or to evaluate the health condition of the patient.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Saviñon-Flores","given":"Fernanda"},{"family":"Méndez","given":"Erika"},{"family":"López-Castaños","given":"Mónica"},{"family":"Carabarin-Lima","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"López-Castaños","given":"Karen A."},{"family":"González-Fuentes","given":"Miguel A."},{"family":"Méndez-Albores","given":"Alia"}],"citation-key":"savinon-flores2021","container-title":"Biosensors","DOI":"10.3390/bios11030066","ISSN":"2079-6374","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"3","page":"66","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Review on SERS-Based Detection of Human Virus Infections: Influenza and Coronavirus","title-short":"A Review on SERS-Based Detection of Human Virus Infections","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/11/3/66","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"sayes","abstract":"A key element of any nanomaterial toxicity screening strategy is a detailed and comprehensive physicochemical characterization of the test material being studied. This is a critical factor for correlating the nanoparticle surface characteristics with any measured biological/toxicological responses, as well as to provide an adequate reference point for comparing toxicity results with the hazard-based findings of other investigators. Moreover, when hazard or risk-based evaluations are made on a particular nanomaterial (based on a variety of studies), it is important to ensure that the nanoparticle-types are identical or very similar in composition. This can only be accomplished if rigorous characterization is conducted. In the absence of an adequate assessment of the physical characteristics, it is easy to draw general conclusions on nanoparticle-types which may have similar chemical compositions but, in fact, have different sizes, shapes, crystal structures, surface coatings, and surface reactivity characteristics. The determination of nanomaterial physicochemical properties is vitally important to nanomedicinal applications in that the fate, accumulation, and transport of nanomaterials through the body over time may be predicted based on specific surface characteristics.

  {"id":"sbalzarini2005","abstract":"This paper presents a computationally efficient, two-dimensional, feature point tracking algorithm for the automated detection and quantitative analysis of particle trajectories as recorded by video imaging in cell biology. The tracking process requires no a priori mathematical modeling of the motion, it is self-initializing, it discriminates spurious detections, and it can handle temporary occlusion as well as particle appearance and disappearance from the image region. The efficiency of the algorithm is validated on synthetic video data where it is compared to existing methods and its accuracy and precision are assessed for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithm is well suited for video imaging in cell biology relying on low-intensity fluorescence microscopy. Its applicability is demonstrated in three case studies involving transport of low-density lipoproteins in endosomes, motion of fluorescently labeled Adenovirus-2 particles along microtubules, and tracking of quantum dots on the plasma membrane of live cells. The present automated tracking process enables the quantification of dispersive processes in cell biology using techniques such as moment scaling spectra.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sbalzarini","given":"I.

Public exhibitions of scientific instruments can provide hands-on experience with technical advances and their applications in the life sciences. The software of such devices, however, is oftentimes not appropriate for this purpose. In this study, we describe a software framework and the necessary computer configuration that is well suited for exposing a complex self-built and software-controlled instrument such as a microscope to laymen under limited supervision, e.g. in museums or schools. We identify several aspects that must be met by such software, and we describe a design that can simultaneously be used to control either (i) a fully functional instrument in a robust and fail-safe manner, (ii) an instrument that has low-cost or only partially working hardware attached for illustration purposes or (iii) a completely virtual instrument without hardware attached. We describe how to assess the educational success of such a device, how to monitor its operation and how to facilitate its maintenance.

  {"id":"schober2024","abstract":"With the recent success of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) based SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, the potential for RNA therapeutics has gained widespread attention. LNPs are promising non-viral delivery vectors to protect and deliver delicate RNA therapeutics, which are ineffective and susceptible to degradation alone. While food and drug administration (FDA) approved formulations have shown significant promise, benchmark lipid formulations still require optimization and improvement. In addition, the translatability of these formulations for several different RNA cargo sizes has not been compared under the same conditions. Herein we analyze “gold standard” lipid formulations for encapsulation efficiency of various non-specific RNA cargo lengths representing antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), small interfering RNA (siRNA), RNA aptamers, and messenger RNA (mRNA), with lengths of 10 bases, 21 base pairs, 96 bases, 996 bases, and 1929 bases, respectively. We evaluate encapsulation efficiency as the percentage of input RNA encapsulated in the final LNP product (EEinput%), which shows discrepancy with the traditional calculation of encapsulation efficiency (EE%). EEinput% is shown to be < 50% for all formulations tested, when EE% is consistently > 85%. We also compared formulations for LNP size (Z-average) and polydispersity index (PDI). LNP size does not appear to be strongly influenced by cargo size, which is a counterintuitive finding. Thoughtful characterization of LNPs, in parallel with consideration of in vitro or in vivo behavior, will guide design and optimization for better understanding and improvement of future RNA therapeutics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Schober","given":"Gretchen B."},{"family":"Story","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Arya","given":"Dev P."}],"citation-key":"schober2024","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-024-52685-1","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,29]]},"language":"en","license":"2024 The Author(s)","note":"1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2024-05-17]","page":"2403","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A careful look at lipid nanoparticle characterization: analysis of benchmark formulations for encapsulation of RNA cargo size gradient","title-short":"A careful look at lipid nanoparticle characterization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-52685-1","volume":"14"},

Malaria pigment (hemozoin) detection by laser desorption mass spectometry (LDMS) was recently shown to be a sensitive (<10 parasites/muL) technique for detecting Plasmodium falciparum parasites cultured in human blood. To examine the use of LDMS in a rapid new malaria screening assay, we followed the time course of P. yoelii infections in mice in parallel with light microscopy and a colorimetric hemozoin assay. Hemozoin was detected by LDMS in 0.3 muL of blood within two days of infection independently of the inoculating dose of 10(6), 10(4), or 10(2) parasite-infected erythrocytes. Microscopy and colorimetric hemozoin determinations lagged the LDMS detection of infections by 2-4 and 3-5 days, respectively, except at the highest inoculation dose.

Here we utilize a single-particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (SP-IRIS) for screening 30 mAbs against Ebola, Sudan, and Lassa viruses (EBOV, SUDV, and LASV) to find out the ideal capture antibodies for whole virus detection using recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) models expressing surface glycoproteins (GPs) of EBOV, SUDV, and LASV. We also make use of the binding properties on SP-IRIS to develop a model for mapping the antibody epitopes on the GP structure. mAbs that bind to mucin-like domain or glycan cap of the EBOV surface GP show the highest signal on SP-IRIS, followed by mAbs that target the GP1-GP2 interface at the base domain. These antibodies were shown to be highly efficacious against EBOV infection in non-human primates in previous studies. For LASV detection, 8.9F antibody showed the best performance on SP-IRIS. This antibody binds to a unique region on the surface GP compared to other 15 mAbs tested. In addition, we demonstrate a novel antibody competition assay using SP-IRIS and rVSV-EBOV models to reveal the competition between mAbs in three successful therapeutic mAb cocktails against EBOV infection. We provide an explanation as to why ZMapp cocktail has higher efficacy compared to the other two cocktails by showing that three mAbs in this cocktail (13C6, 2G4, 4G7) do not compete with each other for binding to EBOV GP. In fact, the binding of 13C6 enhances the binding of 2G4 and 4G7 antibodies.

Presented herein is a new technique to provide the non-uniform electric field required for DEP that does not require electrodes to contact the sample fluid. In our method, electrodes are capacitively-coupled to a fluidic channel through dielectric barriers; the application of a high-frequency electric field to these electrodes then induces an electric field in the channel. This technique combines the cell manipulation abilities of traditional DEP with the ease of fabrication found in insulator-based technologies. A microfluidic device was fabricated based on this principle to determine the feasibility of cell manipulations through contactless DEP (cDEP). We were able to demonstrate cell responses unique to the DEP effect in three separate cell lines.

  {"id":"shao2018","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are diverse, nanoscale membrane vesicles actively released by cells. Similar-sized vesicles can be further classified (e.g., exosomes, microvesicles) based on their biogenesis, size, and biophysical properties. Although initially thought to be cellular debris, and thus under-appreciated, EVs are now increasingly recognized as important vehicles of intercellular communication and circulating biomarkers for disease diagnoses and prognosis. Despite their clinical potential, the lack of sensitive preparatory and analytical technologies for EVs poses a barrier to clinical translation.

  {"id":"sharma2023","abstract":"Extracellular nanocarriers (extracellular vesicles (EVs), lipoproteins, and ribonucleoproteins) of protein and nucleic acids mediate intercellular communication and are clinically adaptable as distinct circulating biomarkers. However, the overlapping size and density of the nanocarriers have so far prevented their efficient physical fractionation, thus impeding independent downstream molecular assays. Here, we report a bias-free high-throughput and high-yield continuous isoelectric fractionation nanocarrier fractionation technique based on their distinct isoelectric points. This nanocarrier fractionation platform is enabled by a robust and tunable linear pH profile provided by water-splitting at a bipolar membrane and stabilized by flow without ampholytes. The linear pH profile that allows easy tuning is a result of rapid equilibration of the water dissociation reaction and stabilization by flow. The platform is automated with a machine learning procedure to allow recalibration for different physiological fluids and nanocarriers. The optimized technique has a resolution of 0.3 ΔpI, sufficient to separate all nanocarriers and even subclasses of nanocarriers. Its performance is then evaluated with several biofluids, including plasma, urine, and saliva samples. Comprehensive, high-purity (plasma: >93%, urine: >95% and saliva: >97%), high-yield (plasma: >78%, urine: >87% and saliva: >96%), and probe-free isolation of ribonucleoproteins in 0.75 mL samples of various biofluids in 30 min is demonstrated, significantly outperforming affinity-based and highly biased gold standards having low yield and day-long protocols. Binary fractionation of EVs and different lipoproteins is also achieved with similar performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Sharma","given":"Himani"},{"family":"Yadav","given":"Vivek"},{"family":"D’Souza-Schorey","given":"Crislyn"},{"family":"Go","given":"David B."},{"family":"Senapati","given":"Satyajyoti"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Hsueh-Chia"}],"citation-key":"sharma2023","container-title":"ACS Nano","container-title-short":"ACS Nano","DOI":"10.1021/acsnano.3c01340","ISSN":"1936-0851","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"publisher":"American Chemical Society","source":"ACS Publications","title":"A Scalable High-Throughput Isoelectric Fractionation Platform for Extracellular Nanocarriers: Comprehensive and Bias-Free Isolation of Ribonucleoproteins from Plasma, Urine, and Saliva","title-short":"A Scalable High-Throughput Isoelectric Fractionation Platform for Extracellular Nanocarriers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.3c01340"},

Here, we report the diagnostic accuracy of simultaneous detection of 6 types of early-stage cancers (lung, breast, colon, liver, pancreas, and stomach) by analyzing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy profiles of exosomes using artificial intelligence in a retrospective study design. It includes classification models that recognize signal patterns of plasma exosomes to identify both their presence and tissues of origin. Using 520 test samples, our system identified cancer presence with an area under the curve value of 0.970. Moreover, the system classified the tumor organ type of 278 early-stage cancer patients with a mean area under the curve of 0.945. The final integrated decision model showed a sensitivity of 90.2% at a specificity of 94.4% while predicting the tumor organ of 72% of positive patients.

  {"id":"shintake2021","abstract":"The author discusses the laser interference method to measure the size of small bio-particles: extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosomes and viruses of nanometer scale in flow cytometry. By introducing a new laser configuration in place of conventional optical system of the flow cytometry, the interference fringe (periodic intensity modulation) is created inside the flow which provides a calibrated scale for the size measurement. The fringe pitch is precisely determined by the crossing angle of laser beams and the wavelength. The transverse size of the beam spot can be much larger than wavelength, for example, 30 micro-meters, where the flow cell design in conventional system can be used with moderated dimensional tolerance. The interaction length of sample with laser becomes longer: ~30 micro-meter and thus the scattering light and fluorescent light in case of labeled particle becomes much higher. Importantly, those signals are modulated in MHz frequency range associated with the periodic intensity modulation of the interference fringe. By measuring modulation depth, we can determine the particle size. We may utilize a bandpass filter or the digital signal processing of FFT, and thus we can drastically improve S/N ratio. This is because of the narrow spectrum of signal and thus effectively eliminates noise from various debris contained in the sample, and also low frequency shot noise in the photo detector signal. Thanks to the above-mentioned merits, it will be possible to measure the size of EVs and exosomes in particle-by-particle basis in reliable dimensional scale at nano-meter resolution. It will be also possible to realize the fast virus detection system for screening passengers in the airport at the current pandemic of COVID-19 and in future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Shintake","given":"T."}],"citation-key":"shintake2021","container-title":"arXiv:2105.11542 [physics]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,21]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Proposal of Absolute Nanometer Size Measurement in Flow Cytometry Based on Laser Interferometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11542"},
  {"id":"shortreed2000","abstract":"In electrophoresis, the migration velocity is used for sizing DNA and proteins or for distinguishing molecules based on charge and hydrodynamic radius. Many protein and DNA assays relevant to disease diagnosis are based on such separations. However, standard protocols are not only slow (minutes to hours) but also insensitive (many molecules in a detectable band). We successfully demonstrated a high-throughput imaging approach that allows determination of the individual electrophoretic mobilities of many molecules at a time. Each measurement only requires a few milliseconds to complete. This opens up the possibility of screening single copies of DNA or proteins within single biological cells for disease markers without performing polymerase chain reaction or other biological amplification. The purpose is not to separate the DNA molecules but to identify each one on the basis of the measured electrophoretic mobility. We developed three different procedures to measure the individual molecular mobilities. The results correlate well with capillary electrophoresis (CE) experiments for the same samples (2−49 kb dsDNA) under identical separation conditions. The implication is that any electrophoresis protocols from slab gels to CE should be adaptable to single-molecule screening for disease diagnosis.","author":[{"family":"Shortreed","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Li","given":"Hanlin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Wei-Hua"},{"family":"Yeung","given":"Edward S."}],"citation-key":"shortreed2000","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

RAPID-enabled light-sheet microscopy reliably reconstructs intact, cleared mouse brains with subcellular resolution, and allowed us to characterize the three-dimensional (3D) spatial clustering of somatostatin-positive neurons in the whole encephalon, including densely labeled areas. Furthermore, it enabled 3D morphological analysis of microglia across the entire brain. Beyond light-sheet microscopy, we demonstrate that RAPID maintains high image quality in various settings, from in vivo fluorescence imaging to 3D tracking of fast-moving organisms. RAPID thus provides a flexible autofocus solution that is suitable for traditional automated microscopy tasks as well as for quantitative analysis of large biological specimens.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Silvestri","given":"L."},{"family":"Müllenbroich","given":"M.

Upon monitoring the trajectories and velocity changes of each individually tracked particle, we obtain detailed information about the number-based particle size distribution. A parameter-free model based on Maxwell’s equations and Mie theory is shown to provide very good agreement with the experimental results for standardized particles of spherical shape.

  {"id":"simon2023","abstract":"Quality control of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, and verification of their safety and efficacy, depends on reliable measurements of critical quality attributes (CQAs). The task becomes particularly challenging for drug products and vaccines containing nanomaterials, where multiple complex CQAs must be identified and monitored. To reduce (i) the risk of measurement bias and (ii) the uncertainty in decision-making during product development, the combination of orthogonal and complementary analytical techniques are generally recommended by regulators. However, despite frequent reference to “orthogonal” and “complementary” in guidance documents, neither term is clearly defined. How does one determine if two analytical methods are orthogonal or complementary to one another? Definitions are needed to design a robust characterization strategy aligned to regulatory needs. Definitions for “orthogonal” and “complementary” are proposed that are compatible with existing metrological terminology and are applicable to complex measurement problems. Orthogonal methods target the quantitative evaluation of the true value of a product attribute to address unknown bias or interference. Complementary measurements include a broader scope of methods that reinforce each other to support a common decision. Examples of the application of these terms are presented, with a focus on measurement of physical properties of nano-enabled drug products, including liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles for cancer treatment, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) and virus-like particles for nucleic acid delivery. The proposed framework represents a first step in advancing the assessment of the orthogonality and complementarity of two measurements and it can potentially serve as the basis for a future international standard. This framework may help product developers to implement more efficient product characterization strategies, accelerate the introduction of novel medicines to the clinic and be applicable to other therapeutics beyond nanomaterial-containing pharmaceuticals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Simon","given":"C.

  {"id":"slattery2024","abstract":"The optimization, intensification, and scale-up of photochemical processes constitute a particular challenge in a manufacturing environment geared primarily toward thermal chemistry. In this work, we present a versatile flow-based robotic platform to address these challenges through the integration of readily available hardware and custom software. Our open-source platform combines a liquid handler, syringe pumps, a tunable continuous-flow photoreactor, inexpensive Internet of Things devices, and an in-line benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to enable automated, data-rich optimization with a closed-loop Bayesian optimization strategy. A user-friendly graphical interface allows chemists without programming or machine learning expertise to easily monitor, analyze, and improve photocatalytic reactions with respect to both continuous and discrete variables.

Nonetheless, challenges persist in optimizing, replicating, and scaling these techniques. These challenges stem from practical considerations such as uneven light absorption and experimental variability, alongside chemical complexities such as poorly understood reaction mechanisms and intricate interactions among various variables. These phases in advancing photocatalytic processes are crucial yet time-consuming components of contemporary chemical manufacturing, requiring expertise and precision owing to their intricate and sensitive nature.\n            \n            \n              RATIONALE\n              In response to the need for efficient optimization of complex photocatalytic reaction conditions, we have developed a robotic platform named RoboChem. RoboChem facilitates the self-optimization, intensification, and scale-up of photocatalytic transformations. By integrating readily available hardware, customized software, and a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm, this platform offers a hands-free and safe solution, mitigating associated challenges. Operating autonomously, RoboChem eliminates the requirement for extensive expertise in photocatalysis or scaling processes to achieve optimal results. This renders RoboChem a valuable collaborative robotic platform suitable for any synthetic organic chemistry laboratory, irrespective of users’ specific familiarity with photocatalysis.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              The robotic platform incorporates several key components, including a liquid handler, syringe pumps, a tunable continuous-flow photoreactor, cost-effective Internet of Things devices, and an in-line nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system. It uses a closed-loop BO approach to systematically explore a chosen parameter space encompassing both discrete and continuous variables. Consequently, the platform excels in identifying optimal reaction conditions that maximize either yield, throughput, or a combination thereof.\n              Operating within a continuous flow microreactor, the platform effectively addresses mass, heat, and photon transport considerations, resulting in the generation of well-structured datasets. These datasets capture both positive and negative results, thereby highlighting the influence of specific variables on the targeted objective function.\n              Furthermore, the optimal conditions identified by the platform have been successfully scaled up within the same continuous flow photoreactor. Manual isolation processes have been applied to obtain meaningful quantities of pure isolated compounds. Notably, the isolated yields closely align with the NMR yields obtained by the platform, validating its high precision and reliability.\n              The platform's capabilities were demonstrated across a diverse set of 19 molecules, covering various facets of photocatalysis, such as hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis, photoredox catalysis, and metallaphotocatalysis. Notably, human involvement was limited to the definition of the parametric space, the preparation of stock solutions and the isolation of pure compounds. The effectiveness of the platform stems from its BO algorithm, which efficiently captures intricate interdependencies among different reaction variables. Consequently, the platform consistently identified optimal reaction conditions that either matched or exceeded those obtained through manual approaches. As a result, the RoboChem platform stands out from conventional synthetic methods by tailoring reaction conditions to the specific needs of each substrate. This capability enables a thorough assessment of the applicability and limitations of the reported transformations, ultimately enhancing their value for potential industrial implementation.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSION\n              The RoboChem robotic platform expedites and streamlines the optimization of photocatalytic transformations, simultaneously enhancing safety and liberating researchers to focus on other creative facets of chemistry.\n              \n                \n                  RoboChem: a benchtop robotic platform for the self-optimization, intensification and scale-up of photocatalytic transformations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Slattery","given":"Aidan"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Zhenghui"},{"family":"Tenblad","given":"Pauline"},{"family":"Sanjosé-Orduna","given":"Jesús"},{"family":"Pintossi","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Den Hartog","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Noël","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"slattery2024","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.adj1817","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6681","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,26]]},"language":"en","page":"eadj1817","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Automated self-optimization, intensification, and scale-up of photocatalysis in flow","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj1817","volume":"383"},

  {"id":"sol","abstract":"The aim of this thesis is to find a novel liquid biomarker for the detection of cancer and to optimize treatment. The first chapter gives an introduction to the oncology biomarker field and focuses on platelets and their role in cancer. In part 1, we evaluate extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are small vesicles released by all types of cells, including tumor cells, into the circulation. They carry protein kinases and can be isolated from plasma. We demonstrate that AKT and ERK kinase protein levels in EVs reflect the cellular expression levels and treatment with kinase inhibitors alters their concentration, depending on the clinical response to the drug. Therefore, EVs may provide a promising biomarker biosource for monitoring of treatment responses. Part 2 starts with reviews describing the function and role of platelets in greater depth. Chapter 3 focusses on thrombocytogenesis and several biological processes in which platelets play a role. Furthermore, the RNA processing machineries harboured by platelets are discussed. Both chapter 3 and 4 evaluate the change platelets undergo after being exposed to tumor and its environment. The exchange of biomolecules with tumor cells results in educated platelets, so-called tumor educated platelets (TEPs). TEPs play a role in several hallmarks of cancer and have the ability to respond to systemic alterations making them an interesting biomarker. In chapter 5 the diagnostic potential of platelets is first discussed. We determine their potential by sequencing the RNA of 283 platelet samples, of which 228 are patients with cancer, and 55 are healthy controls. We reach an accuracy of 96%. Furthermore, we are able to pinpoint the location of the primary tumor with an accuracy of 71%. In part 3, our developed thromboSeq platform is taken to the next level. Several potential confounding factors are taken into account such as age and comorbidity. We show that particle-swarm optimization (PSO)-enhanced algorithms enable efficient selection of RNA biomarker panels. In a validation cohort we apply these algorithms to non-small-cell lung cancer and reach an accuracy of 88% in late stage (n=518) and early-stage 81% accuracy. Finally, in chapter 7 we describe our wet- and dry-lab protocols in detail. This includes platelet RNA isolation, mRNA amplification, and preparation for next-generation sequencing. The dry-lab protocol describes the automated FASTQ file pre-processing to quantified gene counts, quality controls, data normalization and correction, and swarm intelligence-enhanced support vector machine (SVM) algorithm development. Part 4 focuses on central nervous system (CNS) malignancies especially on glioblastoma. Chapter 8 gives an overview of the different liquid biomarkers for diffuse glioma, the most common primary CNS malignancy. In chapter 9 we assess the specificity of the platelet education due to glioblastoma by comparing the RNA profile of TEPs from glioblastoma patients with a neuroinflammatory disease and brain metastasis patients. This results in a detection accuracy of 80%. Secondly, analysis of patients with glioblastoma versus healthy controls in an independent validation series provide a detection accuracy of 95%. Furthermore, we describe the potential value of platelets as a monitoring biomarker for patients with glioma, distinguishing pseudoprogression from real tumor progression. In part 5 thromboSeq is applied to breast cancer diagnostics both as a screening tool in the general population and in a high risk population, BRCA mutated women. In chapter 11 we first apply our technique to an inflammatory condition, multiple sclerosis (MS). Platelet RNA is used as input for the development of a diagnostic MS classifier capable of detecting MS with 80% accuracy in the independent validation series.

  {"id":"sprajc2021","abstract":"In the 1920s, during the first archaeological excavations at Uaxactún, Petén, Guatemala, an architectural complex named Group E was interpreted as an ancient Maya astronomical observatory, intended specifically for sighting the equinoctial and solstitial sunrises. In the following decades, a large number of architectural compounds with the same configuration have been found, most of them in the central lowlands of the Yucatan peninsula. The multiple hypotheses that have been proposed about the astronomical function of these complexes, commonly designated as E Groups, range from those attributing them a paramount role in astronomical observations to those that consider them merely allegorical or commemorative allusions to celestial cycles, without any observational use. This study, based on quantitative analyses of a reasonably large sample of alignment data, as well as on contextual evidence, shows that many of the previous hypotheses cannot be sustained. I argue that E Groups, although built primarily for ritual purposes, were astronomically functional, but also that they had no specific or particularly prominent role in astronomical observations. Their orientations belong to widespread alignment groups, mostly materialized in buildings of other types and explicable in terms of some fundamental concerns of the agriculturally-based Maya societies. I present the evidence demonstrating that the astronomical orientations initially embedded in E Groups, which represent the earliest standardized form of Maya monumental architecture and whose occurrence in practically all early cities in the central Yucatan peninsula attests to their socio-political significance, were later transferred to buildings and compounds of other types. Therefore, it is precisely the importance of the astronomically and cosmologically significant directions, first incorporated in E Groups, that allows us to understand some prominent aspects of ancient Maya architecture and urbanism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Šprajc","given":"Ivan"}],"citation-key":"sprajc2021","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0250785","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,27]]},"language":"en","page":"e0250785","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Astronomical aspects of Group E-type complexes and implications for understanding ancient Maya architecture and urban planning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250785","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"steed2021","abstract":"The daily rhythms of agriculture\nSunlight drives agriculture, and plant circadian rhythms tune the plant's response to daily light-dark cycles. Steed et al. discuss how agricultural productivity might be improved by consideration of how the plant's circadian rhythm alters plant responses to the challenges posed by its environment.\nScience, this issue p. eabc9141\nStructured Abstract\nBACKGROUNDGlobal population growth, increased meat consumption, and concerns about sustainability of resources are driving forces for future agriculture to produce higher yields with reduced inputs. Studies, mostly performed in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, demonstrate that the circadian clock, which is a 24-hour oscillator that is an adaptation to living on a rotating planet, has profound effects on the physiology and development of plants. The circadian system contributes to the regulation of flowering, biomass, photosynthesis, water use, temperature stress responses, and pathogen defenses, which are important yield components in plant crops.\nADVANCESCircadian timing in plants is controlled by circadian oscillators in every cell. These oscillators contain pathways of regulation with high degrees of feedback between transcriptional regulators that are expressed in a temporal series through the day and night cycle. The genetic architecture of these circadian oscillators has been largely solved in plants, animals, and fungi during the last quarter-century. This has revealed a plant-specific set of circadian oscillator genes that are common between the major crops. Genome sequencing of crop plants and genetic mapping studies have demonstrated that agricultural breeding has selected for allelic variants in circadian genes, particularly for agricultural modification of the time to flowering. At the same time, indoor crop growth in controlled environments has expanded opportunities to improve agriculture by simultaneously engineering the external environmental cycles and the internal circadian cycles of crops. This knowledge of the genetic structure of the circadian system; the discoveries that the plant circadian oscillators regulate a swathe of plant physiology, metabolism, and gene expression; and improved genetic tools mean that it is now possible to consider translational research that aims to use the circadian system as an approach to improve crop yield and reduce inputs.\nOUTLOOKCircadian biology might have translational impact in crop science through the practice of “chronoculture,” in which the daily timing of agronomic interventions and the genetic basis of circadian rhythms are targets for crop improvements and reduced inputs. In the short term, this would include the use of automation for round-the-clock monitoring and control of plant crop growth and health. Drones and low-cost single-board computers can capture high-frequency data about rhythms of photosynthesis, gas exchange, water use, stomatal movements, and growth of crops in the field to inform mechanistic and agronomic models of crop growth. Experiments in model systems have demonstrated daily rhythms in the responsiveness of plants to temperature, water, pests, and herbicides. With additional data from studies in crop species on the farm, it might be possible to develop new agronomic approaches in which interventions with nutrients, chemicals, light, and temperature are applied at the time when they are most effective. Breeding new germplasm with greater variation at circadian alleles might contribute to improved growth and sustainability. In the future, gene editing and transgenic approaches could be used to engineer crops. For example, plants with slow-running circadian clocks might be better adapted to high-latitude summers. New tissue-specific gene expression strategies that allow temporal and spatial control of transgene expression represent long-term targets for engineering crops with optimized traits. For example, alteration of circadian function specifically in phloem companion cells could be used to engineer new flowering-time traits without affecting other circadian outputs. By using split protein approaches, it should be possible to express proteins at specific times of day in desired tissues to confer stress tolerance or produce bioproducts for harvest, with less negative effects than constitutive expression. Breeding and transgene approaches are expensive because they are long-term programs subject to regulatory scrutiny. Consequently, there is a need for increased fundamental research and applied agronomic studies investigating the basic mechanism and applied uses of circadian biology in agriculture. Major goals of chronoculture research will be measuring, in the major crops in the field, the impact of the circadian oscillator on yield-relevant traits and quantifying the effect of time of day on agronomic treatments. <img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/372/6541/eabc9141/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Wheat growing in day and night cycles of light and dark and warm and cold.In the light (left), plants photosynthesize, fixing carbon for growth and the production of transient reserves of sugars. At night (right), plants consume stored sugars. Circadian clocks anticipate these environmental cycles and regulate most plant biology.CREDIT: KELLIE HOLOSKI/SCIENCE\nHuman health is dependent on a plentiful and nutritious supply of food, primarily derived from crop plants. Rhythmic supply of light as a result of the day and night cycle led to the evolution of circadian clocks that modulate most plant physiology, photosynthesis, metabolism, and development. To regulate crop traits and adaptation, breeders have indirectly selected for variation at circadian genes. The pervasive impact of the circadian system on crops suggests that future food production might be improved by modifying circadian rhythms, engineering the timing of transgene expression, and applying agricultural treatments at the most effective time of day. We describe the applied research required to take advantage of circadian biology in agriculture to increase production and reduce inputs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Steed","given":"Gareth"},{"family":"Ramirez","given":"Dora Cano"},{"family":"Hannah","given":"Matthew A."},{"family":"Webb","given":"Alex A.

  {"id":"sukla2021","abstract":"Detecting dengue virus (DENV) infection in patients as early as possible makes the disease management convenient. Conventionally, DENV infection is diagnosed by ELISA-based methods, but sensitivity and speciﬁcity are major concerns. Reverse-transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)based detection conﬁrms the presence of DENV RNA; however, it is expensive, time-consuming, and skilled personnel are required. A ﬂuorescence-based detection system that detects DENV RNA in patient’s serum directly, without any nucleic acid ampliﬁcation step, has been developed. The method uses target-speciﬁc complementary sequence in the molecular beacon, which would speciﬁcally bind to the DENV RNA. The molecular beacons are approximately 40 bases long hairpin structures, with a ﬂuorophore-quencher system attached at the terminal ends of the stem. These probes are biotinylated in the stem region, so that they can be immobilized on the streptavidin-tagged magnetic beads. These magnetic beads, coupled with biotinylated molecular beacons, are used for the detection of the target RNA in the serum by incubating the mixture. After incubation, beads are separated and re-suspended in a buffer. The measurement of ﬂuorescence is taken in ﬂuorometer after 15 min incubation at 50 ◦C. The whole work is carried out in a single tube. This rapid method can precisely detect dengue RNA within two hours, conﬁrming ongoing DENV replication in the patient.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Sukla","given":"Soumi"},{"family":"Mondal","given":"Prasenjit"},{"family":"Biswas","given":"Subhajit"},{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Surajit"}],"citation-key":"sukla2021","container-title":"Biosensors","container-title-short":"Biosensors","DOI":"10.3390/bios11120479","ISSN":"2079-6374","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,26]]},"language":"en","page":"479","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Rapid and Easy-to-Perform Method of Nucleic-Acid Based Dengue Virus Diagnosis Using Fluorescence-Based Molecular Beacons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/11/12/479","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"tanke2007","abstract":"Advances in genomics and proteomics increasingly contribute to the understanding of signal transduction pathways that control growth, differentiation, and death of cells. Since defects in these processes may result in the expression of inherited and or acquired disease, the identification of candidate disease genes and modifier genes by parallel use of genotyping together with an integrated study of gene expression and metabolite levels is instrumental for future health care. This approach, called systems biology, aims to recognize early onset of disease, institute preventive treatment, and identify new molecular targets for novel drugs in cancer, cardiovascular and metabolomic disease (e.g., diabetes), and neurodegenerative disorders. Gene interaction networks have recently been demonstrated, in which hub genes, that is, genes that show the highest level of interactions with other genes, play a special role. Hub genes, often chromatin regulators, may act as modifier genes (genes that modify the effect of other genes) in multiple mechanistically unrelated genetic diseases in humans. In addition, it has been shown that small metabolites such as hormones and cytokines, or proteins/enzymes such as C reactive protein (C-RP) and matrix metaloproteinase (MMP), reflect disease status in case of oral cancer, asthma, or periodontal and cardiac disease. Many of these molecular targets, as well as pathogen-specific DNA and RNA sequences, can be measured in oral fluids, providing a unique opportunity to develop novel noninvasive diagnostic tests. Efforts so far concentrate on the use of lab-on-a-chip technology in combination with novel reporters and microsensor arrays to measure multianalytes in oral fluids. Handheld devices that perform sensitive detection of multiple analytes in oral fluid will be obtainable in the near future.","author":[{"family":"Tanke","given":"Hans J."}],"citation-key":"tanke2007","container-title":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Ann N Y Acad Sci","DOI":"10.1196/annals.1384.042","ISSN":"0077-8923","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"330-334","PMID":"17435139","source":"PubMed","title":"Genomics and proteomics: the potential role of oral diagnostics","title-short":"Genomics and proteomics","type":"article-journal","volume":"1098"},

Despite efforts in recent decades, there remains a widespread ignorance about who are the individuals with a greater vocation for research and marketing of knowledge. Focusing on a relatively unexplored context — the field of life sciences in a moderate innovator country, Portugal — this study adds new empirical evidence to the precedents of academic entrepreneurship. The results, based on 247 responses, evidence that entrepreneurship (including patent production, consultancy work and creation of start-up companies) is still very incipient. The econometric analysis of the “Index of entrepreneurial activity,” shows that: (1) the phenomenon of academic entrepreneurship is within everyone’s reach, but embraced by very few; and (2) academic entrepreneurship feeds on the exchange of knowledge and resources among universities and research institutes and their socio-economic environment. Thus, to increase academic entrepreneurship in life science in Portugal, the mechanisms to facilitate the interactions between universities and the business community must be strengthened, promoting the development of business clusters with the integration of the academic world, which will enable the transformation of knowledge into market products and services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Teixeira","given":"Aurora a.

Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid–nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals.

The role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in COVID-19 and their biomarker potential, however, remains largely unknown. Aiming to identify specific EV signatures of patients with mild compared to severe COVID-19, we characterized the EV composition of 20 mild and 26 severe COVID-19 patients along with 16 sex and age-matched healthy donors with a panel of eight different antibodies by imaging flow cytometry (IFCM). We correlated the obtained data with 37 clinical, prerecorded biochemical and immunological parameters. Severe patients’ sera contained increased amounts of CD13+ and CD82+ EVs, which positively correlated with IL-6-producing and circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and with the serum concentration of proinflammatory cytokines, respectively. Sera of mild COVID-19 patients contained more HLA-ABC+ EVs than sera of the healthy donors and more CD24+ EVs than severe COVID-19 patients. Their increased abundance negatively correlated with disease severity and accumulation of MDSCs, being considered as key drivers of immunopathogenesis in COVID-19. Altogether, our results support the potential of serum EVs as powerful biomarkers for COVID-19 severity and pave the way for future investigations aiming to unravel the role of EVs in COVID-19 progression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Tertel","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Tomić","given":"Sergej"},{"family":"Đokić","given":"Jelena"},{"family":"Radojević","given":"Dušan"},{"family":"Stevanović","given":"Dejan"},{"family":"Ilić","given":"Nataša"},{"family":"Giebel","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Kosanović","given":"Maja"}],"citation-key":"tertel2022","container-title":"Journal of Extracellular Vesicles","DOI":"10.1002/jev2.12257","ISSN":"2001-3078","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"e12257","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Serum-derived extracellular vesicles: Novel biomarkers reflecting the disease severity of COVID-19 patients","title-short":"Serum-derived extracellular vesicles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jev2.12257","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"thomas2019","abstract":"To preserve their business model, companies have long protected their innovation processes with patents. « Open source hardware » (OSH) is, on the contrary, a collaborative product development process, where design plans and manufacturing \"secrets\" are accessible to all. The lines between creators and consumers blur more and more, especially when, for example, digital fabrication tools such as 3D printers or laser cutters accessible via Fab Labs or Maker Spaces, enable citizens to create and test products much more easily. Starting from an isolated phenomenon, there are now 1200 Fab Labs in 100 different countries organized in a \"Fab City Network\", to help cities produce within forty years 50% of the resources they consume.In this context, building a drone to depollute oceans, connected beehives, or a water filter in « Open Source Hardware » (OSH) aims at creating solutions in a more rapid, efficient and inexpensive manner. Furthermore, these innovations are voluntarily kept free by law. They represent a knowledge base, a \"digital common good\", meaning a reserve of ideas and solutions available on the internet via numerical platforms. According to Elinor Ostrom, who received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009, \"the challenge of the current generation is to keep the pathways to discovery open\" (Hess & Ostrom, 2011). Without attaining the success of open source software initiatives, in practice, these OSH initiatives have continued to spread.But how can a sustainable economic model be developed when co-constructed innovations can be shared by all? Thus, our research questions are the following: 1) How to monetize value created through OSH? 2) How can the business model framework be extended to include value creation and sharing for all stakeholders? 3) In the context of OSH, how does a business model hold together?The OSH phenomenon is not specific to a single sector, company or territory, but is indicative of much more global transformation. To understand the conditions necessary for the survival and growth of OSH, we conducted a qualitative study on the “OSH ecosystem” that allowed us to study the community, firm and territorial ecosystems levels together.Data was collected in three successive phases. First, qualitative interviews were conducted with twenty-three initiatives from the \"Open Source Hardware Observatory\". These, of course, corresponded to our research criteria, that is the development of complex mechatronic or textile products labeled opened by their surrounding community. Then we conducted a case study on four actors in the automotive sector to study their reaction to OSH developed by innovation communities. The final phase consisted of running an empirical study of the actors in the OSH innovation ecosystem of the city of Barcelona, chosen for its pivotal role in the \"Fab Cities\" network.Our results show that these initiatives are strongly focused on democratic values aimed at putting technology at the service of humanity. While these values are a powerful vector for federating actors, success is stalled in companies that do not adhere to them. These will primarily focus on the associated risks. Finally, we identified a diversity of possible and configurable revenues to be shaped according to an organization's strategic needs: 1) external financing; 2) a combination of products and services; 3) strategic competence; 4) the model platform, and 5) the distributed enterprise. Together, they enable an OSH initiative to progressively refine its business model, grow in value, and increase its impact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomas","given":"Laetitia"}],"citation-key":"thomas2019","genre":"phdthesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,22]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Université Grenoble Alpes","source":"theses.hal.science","title":"Business models for open source hardware","type":"thesis","URL":"https://theses.hal.science/tel-02504769"},

Of these, the monumental, rectilinear type known as mustatils has received only limited attention. Recent fieldwork in AlUla and Khaybar Counties, Saudi Arabia, demonstrates that these monuments are architecturally more complex than previously supposed, featuring chambers, entranceways and orthostats. These structures can now be interpreted as ritual installations dating back to the late sixth millennium BC, with recent excavations revealing the earliest evidence for a cattle cult in the Arabian Peninsula. As such, mustatils are amongst the earliest stone monuments in Arabia and globally one of the oldest monumental building traditions yet identified.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomas","given":"Hugh"},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"Melissa A."},{"family":"Dalton","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"McMahon","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Boyer","given":"David"},{"family":"Repper","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"thomas2021","container-title":"Antiquity","DOI":"10.15184/aqy.2021.51","ISSN":"0003-598X, 1745-1744","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-22","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"The mustatils: cult and monumentality in Neolithic north-western Arabia","title-short":"The mustatils","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/mustatils-cult-and-monumentality-in-neolithic-northwestern-arabia/80E2AD8B538C268E7CA5C3C29CB4EC52#"},

Building upon a laboratory-built high-sensitivity flow cytometer (HSFCM), we report here a rapid approach for quantitative multiparameter analysis of single EVs down to 40 nm with an analysis rate up to 10 000 particles per minute. Statistically robust particle size distribution was acquired in minutes with a resolution and profile well matched with those of cryo-TEM measurements. Subpopulations of EVs expressing CD9, CD63, and/or CD81 were quantified upon immunofluorescent staining. When HSFCM was used to analyze blood samples, a significantly elevated level of CD147-positive EVs was identified in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). HSFCM provides a sensitive and rapid platform for surface protein profiling and sizing of individual EVs, which could greatly aid the understanding of EV-mediated intercellular communication and the development of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Tian","given":"Ye"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Manfei"},{"family":"Su","given":"Guoqiang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Shaobin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wenqiang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhibin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Chaoxiang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Lihong"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Lina"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Xiaomei"}],"citation-key":"tian2018","container-title":"ACS Nano","container-title-short":"ACS Nano","DOI":"10.1021/acsnano.7b07782","ISSN":"1936-0851","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,23]]},"page":"671-680","publisher":"American Chemical Society","source":"ACS Publications","title":"Protein Profiling and Sizing of Extracellular Vesicles from Colorectal Cancer Patients via Flow Cytometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.7b07782","volume":"12"},

Such cultures, started either from spontaneous cell aggregates or single cells dispersed in a gel are time consuming, applicable to restricted cell types only, prone to high variation, and do not allow CS formation with defined spatial distribution required for high-throughput imaging. Here, we describe a method where cell-polymer suspensions are microinjected as droplets into collagen gels and CS formation occurs within hours for a broad range of cell types. We have automated this method to produce CS arrays in fixed patterns with defined x-y-z spatial coordinates in 96 well plates and applied automated imaging and image analysis algorithms. Low intra- and inter-well variation of initial CS size and CS expansion indicates excellent reproducibility. Distinct cell migration patterns, including cohesive strand-like – and individual cell migration can be visualized and manipulated. A proof-of-principle chemical screen is performed identifying compounds that affect cancer cell invasion/migration. Finally, we demonstrate applicability to freshly isolated mouse breast and human sarcoma biopsy material – indicating potential for development of personalized cancer treatment strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Truong","given":"Hoa H."},{"family":"Sonneville","given":"Jan","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Ghotra","given":"Veerander P.

  {"id":"ugawa2021","abstract":"Characterization and isolation of a large population of cells are indispensable procedures in biological sciences. Flow cytometry is one of the standards that offers a method to characterize and isolate cells at high throughput. When performing flow cytometry, cells are molecularly stained with fluorescent labels to adopt biomolecular specificity which is essential for characterizing cells. However, molecular staining is costly and its chemical toxicity can cause side effects to the cells which becomes a critical issue when the cells are used downstream as medical products or for further analysis. Here, we introduce a high-throughput stain-free flow cytometry called in silico-labeled ghost cytometry which characterizes and sorts cells using machine-predicted labels. Instead of detecting molecular stains, we use machine learning to derive the molecular labels from compressive data obtained with diffractive and scattering imaging methods. By directly using the compressive ‘imaging’ data, our system can accurately assign the designated label to each cell in real time and perform sorting based on this judgment. With this method, we were able to distinguish different cell states, cell types derived from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and subtypes of peripheral white blood cells using only stain-free modalities. Our method will find applications in cell manufacturing for regenerative medicine as well as in cell-based medical diagnostic assays in which fluorescence labeling of the cells is undesirable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ugawa","given":"Masashi"},{"family":"Kawamura","given":"Yoko"},{"family":"Toda","given":"Keisuke"},{"family":"Teranishi","given":"Kazuki"},{"family":"Morita","given":"Hikari"},{"family":"Adachi","given":"Hiroaki"},{"family":"Tamoto","given":"Ryo"},{"family":"Nomaru","given":"Hiroko"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Keiji"},{"family":"Sugimoto","given":"Keiki"},{"family":"Borisova","given":"Evgeniia"},{"family":"An","given":"Yuri"},{"family":"Konishi","given":"Yusuke"},{"family":"Tabata","given":"Seiichiro"},{"family":"Morishita","given":"Soji"},{"family":"Imai","given":"Misa"},{"family":"Takaku","given":"Tomoiku"},{"family":"Araki","given":"Marito"},{"family":"Komatsu","given":"Norio"},{"family":"Hayashi","given":"Yohei"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Issei"},{"family":"Horisaki","given":"Ryoichi"},{"family":"Noji","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Ota","given":"Sadao"}],"citation-key":"ugawa2021","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.67660","editor":[{"family":"Iqbal","given":"Jameel"},{"family":"Zaidi","given":"Mone"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Gregory"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,21]]},"page":"e67660","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"In silico-labeled ghost cytometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67660","volume":"10"},

Opportunities to apply ML occur in all stages of drug discovery. Examples include target validation, identification of prognostic biomarkers and analysis of digital pathology data in clinical trials. Applications have ranged in context and methodology, with some approaches yielding accurate predictions and insights. The challenges of applying ML lie primarily with the lack of interpretability and repeatability of ML-generated results, which may limit their application. In all areas, systematic and comprehensive high-dimensional data still need to be generated. With ongoing efforts to tackle these issues, as well as increasing awareness of the factors needed to validate ML approaches, the application of ML can promote data-driven decision making and has the potential to speed up the process and reduce failure rates in drug discovery and development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Vamathevan","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Dominic"},{"family":"Czodrowski","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Dunham","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Ferran","given":"Edgardo"},{"family":"Lee","given":"George"},{"family":"Li","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Madabhushi","given":"Anant"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Parantu"},{"family":"Spitzer","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Shanrong"}],"citation-key":"vamathevan2019","container-title":"Nature Reviews Drug Discovery","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Drug Discov","DOI":"10.1038/s41573-019-0024-5","ISSN":"1474-1784","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 Springer Nature Limited","number":"6","page":"463-477","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Applications of machine learning in drug discovery and development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-019-0024-5","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"vandergrein2019","abstract":"Several naked virus species, including members of the Picornaviridae family, have recently been described to escape their host cells and spread infection via enclosure in extracellular vesicles (EV). EV are 50–300 nm sized lipid membrane-enclosed particles produced by all cells that are broadly recognized for playing regulatory roles in numerous (patho)physiological processes, including viral infection. Both pro- and antiviral functions have been ascribed to EV released by virus-infected cells. It is currently not known whether this reported functional diversity is a result of the release of multiple virus-containing and non-virus containing EV subpopulations that differ in composition and function. Using encephalomyocarditis virus infection (EMCV, Picornaviridae family), we here provide evidence that EV populations released by infected cells are highly heterogeneous. Virus was contained in two distinct EV populations that differed in physical characteristics, such as sedimentation properties, and in enrichment for proteins indicative of different EV biogenesis pathways, such as the plasma membrane resident proteins Flotillin-1 and CD9, and the autophagy regulatory protein LC3. Additional levels of EV heterogeneity were identified using high-resolution flow cytometric analysis of single EV. Importantly, we demonstrate that EV subsets released during EMCV infection varied largely in potency of transferring virus infection and in their kinetics of release from infected cells. These data support the notion that heterogeneous EV populations released by virus-infected cells can exert diverse functions at distinct time points during infection. Unraveling the compositional, temporal and functional heterogeneity of these EV populations using single EV analysis technologies, as employed in this study, is vital to understanding the role of EV in virus dissemination and antiviral host responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Grein","given":"Susanne G.","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Defourny","given":"Kyra A.

  {"id":"vandergrein2022","abstract":"Naked viruses can escape host cells before the induction of lysis via release in extracellular vesicles (EVs). These nanosized EVs cloak the secreted virus particles in a host-derived membrane, which alters virus-host interactions that affect infection efficiency and antiviral immunity. Currently, little is known about the viral and host factors regulating this form of virus release. Here, we assessed the role of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) Leader protein, a ‘viral security protein’ that subverts the host antiviral response. EV release upon infection with wildtype virus or a Leader-deficient mutant was characterized at the single particle level using high-resolution flow cytometry. Inactivation of the Leader abolished EV induction during infection and strongly reduced EV-enclosed virus release. We demonstrate that the Leader promotes the release of virions within EVs by stimulating a secretory arm of autophagy. This newly discovered role of the EMCV Leader adds to the variety of mechanisms via which this protein affects virus-host interactions. Moreover, these data provide first evidence for a crucial role of a non-structural viral protein in the non-lytic release of picornaviruses via packaging in EVs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Grein","given":"Susanne G.","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Defourny","given":"Kyra A.

In blood plasma, EVs are outnumbered by similar-sized lipoprotein particles (LPs), leading to controversial data such as non-specific binding of antibodies to LPs. Flow cytometry is a clinically applicable technique to characterize single EVs in body fluids. However, flow cytometry data have arbitrary units, impeding standardization, data comparison, and data interpretation, such as differentiation between EVs and LPs. Here we present a new method, named flow cytometry scatter ratio (Flow-SR), to relate the ambiguous light scattering signals of flow cytometry to the diameter and refractive index (RI) of single nanoparticles between 200-500 nm in diameter. Flow-SR enables label-free differentiation between EVs and LPs and improves data interpretation and comparison. Because Flow-SR is easy to implement, widely applicable, and more accurate and faster than existing techniques to size nanoparticles in suspension, Flow-SR has numerous applications in nanomedicine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pol","given":"Edwin","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Rond","given":"Leonie","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Coumans","given":"Frank A.

In this review we focus on the technical limitations and pitfalls of the most common CTC isolation and detection strategies. Additionally, we emphasize the difficulties in correctly classifying rare cells as CTCs using common biomarkers.

  {"id":"vantricht2017","abstract":"During development of adenovirus-based vaccines, samples have to be analyzed in order to either monitor the production process or control the quality and safety of the product. An important quality attribute is the total concentration of intact adenoviruses, which currently is determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or anion exchange-HPLC. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) was evaluated as alternative to the current methods with the aim to have one single method that allows reliable and fast quantiﬁcation of adenovirus particles throughout the full process. Intact adenoviruses samples from downstream processing and upstream processing were analyzed directly by CE with UV-detection at 214 nm. Only the samples with high amounts of DNA required a simple sample pretreatment by benzonase. Adenovirus particles were separated from matrix components such as cell debris, residual cell DNA, and/or proteins on a PVA-coated capillary using a BGE consisting of 125 mM Tris, 338 mM tricine and 0.2% v/v polysorbate-20 at pH 7.7. Full factorial design of experiments was used for method optimization as part of the analytical quality by design (AQbD) method development approach. The method was validated for the quantiﬁcation of adenoviruses on ﬁve representative samples from the manufacturing process in the range of 0.5×1011–1.5×1011 adenovirus particles per ml (~80 to 250 pmol/l). The CE method showed intermediate precision of 7.8% RSD on concentration and an accuracy (spiked recovery) of 95–110%. CE proved highly useful for process development support and is being implemented for in-process control testing for adenovirus vaccine manufacturing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Tricht","given":"Ewoud","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Geurink","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Backus","given":"Harold"},{"family":"Germano","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Somsen","given":"Govert W."},{"family":"Sänger–van de Griend","given":"Cari E."}],"citation-key":"vantricht2017","container-title":"Talanta","DOI":"10.1016/j.talanta.2017.01.013","ISSN":"00399140","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5]]},"language":"en","page":"8-14","source":"Crossref","title":"One single, fast and robust capillary electrophoresis method for the direct quantification of intact adenovirus particles in upstream and downstream processing samples","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039914017300140","volume":"166"},

Dutch universities are ranked high on research output but there is scarce evidence about the commercialization of research-based innovation. We present a novel approach to measure the performance of university technology transfer using meta data analysis. We use data on research output as meta-data to estimates the potential for technology transfer, and data about the actual technology transfer projects as measured by patents, license agreements and spin-offs.

  {"id":"wagner2014","abstract":"Asymmetric ﬂow ﬁeld-ﬂow fractionation (AF4) is a widely used and versatile technique in the family of ﬁeldﬂow fractionations, indicated by a rapidly increasing number of publications. It represents a gentle separation and characterization method, where nonspeciﬁc interactions are reduced to a minimum, allows a broad separation range from several nano- up to micrometers and enables a superior characterization of homo- and heterogenic systems. In particular, coupling to multiangle light scattering provides detailed access to sample properties. Information about molar mass, polydispersity, size, shape/conformation, or density can be obtained nearly independent of the used material. In this Perspective, the application and progress of AF4 for (bio)macromolecules and colloids, relevant for “nano” medical and pharmaceutical issues, will be presented. The characterization of diﬀerent nanosized drug or gene delivery systems, e.g., polymers, nanoparticles, micelles, dendrimers, liposomes, polyplexes, and virus-like-particles (VLP), as well as therapeutic relevant proteins, antibodies, and nanoparticles for diagnostic usage will be discussed. Thereby, the variety of obtained information, the advantages and pitfalls of this emerging technique will be highlighted. Additionally, the inﬂuence of diﬀerent fractionation parameters in the separation process is discussed in detail. Moreover, a comprehensive overview is given, concerning the investigated samples, fractionation parameters as membrane types and buﬀers used as well as the chosen detectors and the corresponding references. The perspective ends up with an outlook to the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Wagner","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Holzschuh","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Traeger","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Fahr","given":"Alfred"},{"family":"Schubert","given":"Ulrich.

Nanophotonic structures composed of metallic and/or dielectric building blocks excel at focusing light into ultrasmall volumes, creating enhanced electromagnetic near-fields ideal for amplifying the molecular signal readout. Furthermore, fluidic control on small length scales enables precise tailoring of the spatial overlap between the electromagnetic hotspots and the analytes, boosting light-matter interaction, and can be utilized to integrate advanced functionalities for the pre-treatment of samples in real-world-use cases, such as purification, separation, or dilution.

The extraction of 3D positions from sub-cellular objects of interest is achieved by calibrating the depth-dependent response of the imaging system using fluorescent beads mixed with the sample buffer.

  {"id":"wel2016","abstract":"Quantitative tracking of features from video images is a basic technique employed in many areas of science. Here, we present a method for the tracking of features that partially overlap, in order to be able to track so-called colloidal molecules. Our approach implements two improvements into existing particle tracking algorithms. Firstly, we use the history of previously identified feature locations to successfully find their positions in consecutive frames. Secondly, we present a framework for non-linear least-squares fitting to summed radial model functions and analyze the accuracy (bias) and precision (random error) of the method on artificial data. We find that our tracking algorithm correctly identifies overlapping features with an accuracy below 0.2% of the feature radius and a precision of 0.1 to 0.01 pixels for a typical image of a colloidal cluster. Finally, we use our method to extract the three-dimensional diffusion tensor from the Brownian motion of colloidal dimers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wel","given":"Casper","dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Kraft","given":"Daniela J."}],"citation-key":"wel2016","container-title":"Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter","container-title-short":"J.

However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000–2,000 years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39% represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Wibowo","given":"Marsha C."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Borry","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Hübner","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Kun D."},{"family":"Tierney","given":"Braden T."},{"family":"Zimmerman","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Barajas-Olmos","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Contreras-Cubas","given":"Cecilia"},{"family":"García-Ortiz","given":"Humberto"},{"family":"Martínez-Hernández","given":"Angélica"},{"family":"Luber","given":"Jacob M."},{"family":"Kirstahler","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Blohm","given":"Tre"},{"family":"Smiley","given":"Francis E."},{"family":"Arnold","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Ballal","given":"Sonia A."},{"family":"Pamp","given":"Sünje Johanna"},{"family":"Russ","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Maixner","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Rota-Stabelli","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Segata","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Reinhard","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Orozco","given":"Lorena"},{"family":"Warinner","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Snow","given":"Meradeth"},{"family":"LeBlanc","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Kostic","given":"Aleksandar D."}],"citation-key":"wibowo2021","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03532-0","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7862","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Archaeology;Metagenomics;Microbiome\nSubject_term_id: archaeology;metagenomics;microbiome","number":"7862","page":"234-239","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Reconstruction of ancient microbial genomes from the human gut","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03532-0","volume":"594"},

  {"id":"wiklander2018","abstract":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be harvested from cell culture supernatants and from all body fluids. EVs can be conceptually classified based on their size and biogenesis as exosomes and microvesicles. Nowadays, it is however commonly accepted in the field that there is a much higher degree of heterogeneity within these two subgroups than previously thought. For instance, the surface marker profile of EVs is likely dependent on the cell source, the cell's activation status, and multiple other parameters. Within recent years, several new methods and assays to study EV heterogeneity in terms of surface markers have been described; most of them are being based on flow cytometry. Unfortunately, such methods generally require dedicated instrumentation, are time-consuming and demand extensive operator expertise for sample preparation, acquisition, and data analysis. In this study, we have systematically evaluated and explored the use of a multiplex bead-based flow cytometric assay which is compatible with most standard flow cytometers and facilitates a robust semi-quantitative detection of 37 different potential EV surface markers in one sample simultaneously. First, assay variability, sample stability over time, and dynamic range were assessed together with the limitations of this assay in terms of EV input quantity required for detection of differently abundant surface markers. Next, the potential effects of EV origin, sample preparation, and quality of the EV sample on the assay were evaluated. The findings indicate that this multiplex bead-based assay is generally suitable to detect, quantify, and compare EV surface signatures in various sample types, including unprocessed cell culture supernatants, cell culture-derived EVs isolated by different methods, and biological fluids. Furthermore, the use and limitations of this assay to assess heterogeneities in EV surface signatures was explored by combining different sets of detection antibodies in EV samples derived from different cell lines and subsets of rare cells. Taken together, this validated multiplex bead-based flow cytometric assay allows robust, sensitive, and reproducible detection of EV surface marker expression in various sample types in a semi-quantitative way and will be highly valuable for many researchers in the EV field in different experimental contexts.","author":[{"family":"Wiklander","given":"Oscar P.

Digital immunoassay technology has improved detection sensitivity three logs, to the attomolar range (10−16 M).

The instrument is capable of single-molecule sensitivity and multiplexing with short turnaround times and a throughput of 66 samples/h.

  {"id":"wolos2020","abstract":"Mapping primordial reaction networks\nChemists seeking to understand the origins of life have published a wide range of reactions that may have yielded the building blocks of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids from simple precursors. Wołos et al. scoured the literature to document each such reaction class and then wrote software that applied the reactions first to the simplest compounds such as cyanide, water, and ammonia, and then iteratively to each successive generation of products. The resulting network predicted a variety of previously unappreciated routes to biochemically relevant compounds, several of which the authors validated experimentally.\nScience, this issue p. eaaw1955\nStructured Abstract\nINTRODUCTIONAlthough hundreds of organic reactions have been validated under consensus prebiotic conditions, we still have only a fragmentary understanding of how these individual steps combined into complete synthetic pathways to generate life’s building blocks, which other abiotic molecules might have also formed, how independent reactions gave rise to chemical systems, and how membranes encapsulating these systems came into being. Answering such questions requires consideration of very large numbers of possible synthetic pathways. Starting with even a few primordial substrates—e.g., H2O, N2, HCN, NH3, CH4, and H2S—the number of prebiotically synthesizable molecules grows rapidly into the tens of thousands. Detailed analysis of this space and its synthetic connectivity may be beyond the cognition of individual chemists but can be performed by smart computer algorithms.\nRATIONALEWe harnessed the power of computer-assisted organic synthesis to map the network of molecules that are synthesizable from basic prebiotic feedstocks. This was done by encoding currently known prebiotic reactions in a machine-readable format, augmenting these reaction transforms with information about incompatible groups and reaction conditions, and then applying them iteratively to a set of basic prebiotic substrates. The reaction network thus created was queried by algorithms to identify complete synthetic routes as well as those tracing reaction systems—notably, reaction cycles. All calculations were supported by a software application that is freely available to the scientific community.\nRESULTSWe demonstrate that this network comprises more abiotic molecules than biotic molecules. The biotic compounds differ from the abiotic compounds in several ways: They are more hydrophilic, more thermodynamically stable, and more balanced in terms of the hydrogen bond donors and acceptors they contain and are synthesizable along routes with fewer changes of conditions. The network contains not only all known syntheses of biotic compounds but also previously unidentified routes, several of which (e.g., prebiotic syntheses of acetaldehyde and diglycine, as well as malic, fumaric, citric, and uric acids) we validated by experiment. We also demonstrate three notable forms of chemical emergence: (i) that the molecules created within the network can themselves enable new types of prebiotic reactions; (ii) that within just a few synthetic generations, simple chemical systems (including self-regenerating cycles) begin to emerge; and (iii) that the network contains prebiotic routes to surfactant species, thus outlining a path to biological compartmentalization. We support these conclusions with experimental results, establishing previously undescribed prebiotic reactions and entire reaction systems—notably, a self-regenerating cycle of iminodiacetic acid.\nCONCLUSIONComputer-generated reaction networks are useful in identifying synthetic routes to prebiotically relevant targets and are indispensable for the discovery of prebiotic chemical systems that are otherwise challenging to discern. As our network continues to grow by means of crowd-sourcing of newly validated prebiotic reactions, it will allow continued simulation of chemical genesis, beginning with molecules as simple as water, ammonia, and methane and leading to increasingly complex targets, including those of current interest in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. <img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/369/6511/eaaw1955/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Network of prebiotic chemistry.Computer simulation of plausible prebiotic reactions creates a network of molecules that are synthesizable from prebiotic feedstocks and establishes multiple unreported—but now experimentally validated—syntheses of prebiotic targets as well as self-regenerating cycles. In this schematic illustration, light blue nodes represent abiotic molecules, dark blue nodes represent molecules along newly discovered prebiotic syntheses of uric and citric acids, and red nodes represent other biotic molecules.\nThe challenge of prebiotic chemistry is to trace the syntheses of life’s key building blocks from a handful of primordial substrates. Here we report a forward-synthesis algorithm that generates a full network of prebiotic chemical reactions accessible from these substrates under generally accepted conditions. This network contains both reported and previously unidentified routes to biotic targets, as well as plausible syntheses of abiotic molecules.

Specifically, we demonstrate fTIRFM of individual NPs in nanofluidic channels shallower than the evanescent field and use the resultant illumination field to gain insight into the behavior and electrokinetic properties of individual NP transport in channels. We find that the electrophoretic mobility of nanoparticles in 100-nm channels is lower than in larger channels or in bulk, presumably due to hindrance effects. Furthermore, we notice a non-intuitive increase in mobility with buffer concentration, which we attribute to electric double layer interactions. Finally, since the evanescent field intensity decreases with distance from the channel wall, we use the measured fluorescence intensity to report probable transverse distributions of free-solution 42-nm polystyrene fluorescent particles. Our method promises to be useful for characterizing nanoscale molecules for many applications in drug discovery, bioanalytics, nanoparticle synthesis, viral targeting, and the basic science of understanding nanoparticle behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Wynne","given":"Thomas M."},{"family":"Dixon","given":"Alexander H."},{"family":"Pennathur","given":"Sumita"}],"citation-key":"wynne2012","container-title":"Microfluidics and Nanofluidics","container-title-short":"Microfluid Nanofluid","DOI":"10.1007/s10404-011-0884-4","ISSN":"1613-4982, 1613-4990","issue":"1-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"411-421","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Electrokinetic characterization of individual nanoparticles in nanofluidic channels","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10404-011-0884-4","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"xu2022","abstract":"Understanding how lithium-ion dynamics affect the (de)lithiation mechanisms of state-of-the-art nickel-rich layered oxide cathodes is crucial to improve electrochemical performance. Here, we directly observe two distinct kinetically induced lithium heterogeneities within single-crystal LiNixMnyCo(1−x−y)O2 (NMC) particles using recently developed operando optical microscopy, challenging the notion that uniform (de)lithiation occurs within individual particles. Upon delithiation, a rapid increase in lithium diffusivity at the beginning of charge results in particles with lithium-poor peripheries and lithium-rich cores. The slow ion diffusion at near-full lithiation states—and slow charge transfer kinetics—also leads to heterogeneity at the end of discharge, with a lithium-rich surface preventing complete lithiation. Finite-element modeling confirms that concentration-dependent diffusivity is necessary to reproduce these phenomena. Our results demonstrate how kinetic limitations cause significant first-cycle capacity losses in Ni-rich cathodes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Merryweather","given":"Alice J."},{"family":"Pandurangi","given":"Shrinidhi S."},{"family":"Lun","given":"Zhengyan"},{"family":"Hall","given":"David S."},{"family":"Deshpande","given":"Vikram S."},{"family":"Fleck","given":"Norman A."},{"family":"Schnedermann","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Rao","given":"Akshay"},{"family":"Grey","given":"Clare P."}],"citation-key":"xu2022","container-title":"Joule","container-title-short":"Joule","DOI":"10.1016/j.joule.2022.09.008","ISSN":"2542-4351","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,16]]},"language":"en","page":"2535-2546","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Operando visualization of kinetically induced lithium heterogeneities in single-particle layered Ni-rich cathodes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435122004743","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"yan2006","abstract":"A thermoreversible fibrillar hydrogel has been formed from an aqueous lysozyme solution in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT). Its physical properties and potential as a tissue engineering scaffold have been explored. Hydrogels were prepared by dissolving 3 mM protein in a 20 mM DTT/water mixture, heating to 85 °C and cooling at room temperature. No gel was observed for the equivalent sample without DTT. The elastic nature of the gel formed was confirmed by rheology, and the storage modulus of our gel was found to be of the same order of magnitude as for other cross-linked biopolymers. Micro differential scanning calorimetry (microDSC) experiments confirmed that the hydrogel was thermally reversible and that gelation and melting occurs through a solid−liquid-like first-order transition. Infrared spectroscopy of the hydrogel and transmission electron microscopy studies of very dilute samples revealed the presence of β-sheet-rich fibrils that were ∼4−6 nm in diameter and 1 μm in length. These fibrils are thought to self-assemble along their long axes to form larger fibers that become physically entangled to form the three-dimensional network observed in both cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) studies. The hydrogel was subsequently cultured with 3T3 fibroblasts and cells spread extensively after 7 days and stretched actin filaments formed that were roughly parallel to each other, indicating the development of organized actin filaments in the form of stress fibers in cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Yan","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Saiani","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Gough","given":"Julie E."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Aline F."}],"citation-key":"yan2006","container-title":"Biomacromolecules","container-title-short":"Biomacromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/bm0605560","ISSN":"1525-7797","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",10,1]]},"page":"2776-2782","publisher":"American Chemical Society","source":"ACS Publications","title":"Thermoreversible Protein Hydrogel as Cell Scaffold","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1021/bm0605560","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"zada2018","abstract":"The abundance of plastic products in modern society has resulted in a proliferation of small plastic particles called “microplastics” in the global environment. Currently, spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier‐transform infrared and spontaneous (i.e., conventional) Raman spectroscopy are widely employed for the identification of the plastic microparticles, but these are rather time consuming. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, based on the coherent interaction of 2 different laser beams with vibrational levels in the molecules of the sample, would enable much faster detection and identification of microplastics. Here, we present for the first time an SRS‐based method for identifying 5 different high production‐volume polymer types in microplastics extracted from environmental or consumer product samples. The particles from the extracts were collected on a flat alumina filter, and 6 SRS images were acquired at specifically chosen wavenumbers. Next, we decomposed these spectral data into specific images for the 5 polymers selected for calibration. We tested the approach on an artificial mixture of plastic particles and determined the signal‐to‐noise and level of cross talk for the 5 polymer types. As a proof of principle, we identified polyethylene terephthalate particles extracted from a commercial personal care product, demonstrating also the thousand‐fold higher speed of mapping with SRS compared with conventional Raman. Furthermore, after density separation of a Rhine estuary sediment sample, we scanned 1 cm2 of the filter surface in less than 5 hr and detected and identified 88 microplastics, which corresponds to 12,000 particles per kilogram dry weight. We conclude that SRS can be an efficient method for monitoring microplastics in the environment and potentially many other matrices of interest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zada","given":"Liron"},{"family":"Leslie","given":"Heather A."},{"family":"Vethaak","given":"A.

  {"id":"zagajewski2023","abstract":"The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the greatest public health challenges, already causing up to 1.2 million deaths annually and rising. Current culture-based turnaround times for bacterial identification in clinical samples and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) are typically 18–24 h. We present a novel proof-of-concept methodological advance in susceptibility testing based on the deep-learning of single-cell specific morphological phenotypes directly associated with antimicrobial susceptibility in Escherichia coli. Our models can reliably (80% single-cell accuracy) classify untreated and treated susceptible cells for a lab-reference fully susceptible E. coli strain, across four antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, rifampicin and co-amoxiclav). For ciprofloxacin, we demonstrate our models reveal significant (p &lt; 0.001) differences between bacterial cell populations affected and unaffected by antibiotic treatment, and show that given treatment with a fixed concentration of 10 mg/L over 30 min these phenotypic effects correlate with clinical susceptibility defined by established clinical breakpoints. Deploying our approach on cell populations from six E. coli strains obtained from human bloodstream infections with varying degrees of ciprofloxacin resistance and treated with a range of ciprofloxacin concentrations, we show single-cell phenotyping has the potential to provide equivalent information to growth-based AST assays, but in as little as 30 min. Based on the phenotypic response of Escherichia coli cells to antibiotic treatment, a deep-learning approach could rapidly distinguish susceptible and resistant cells from fluorescence microscopy images.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Zagajewski","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Piers"},{"family":"Feehily","given":"Conor"},{"family":"El Sayyed","given":"Hafez"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Monique"},{"family":"Barrett","given":"Lucinda"},{"family":"Oakley","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Stracy","given":"Mathew"},{"family":"Crook","given":"Derrick"},{"family":"Nellåker","given":"Christoffer"},{"family":"Stoesser","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Kapanidis","given":"Achillefs N."}],"citation-key":"zagajewski2023","container-title":"Communications Biology","container-title-short":"Commun Biol","DOI":"10.1038/s42003-023-05524-4","ISSN":"2399-3642","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,14]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-12","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Deep learning and single-cell phenotyping for rapid antimicrobial susceptibility detection in Escherichia coli","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05524-4","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"zhai2018","abstract":"Breast cancer is the second cause of cancer mortality in women globally. Early detection, treatment, and metastasis monitoring are of great importance to favorable prognosis. Although conventional diagnostic methods, such as breast X-ray mammography and image positioning biopsy, are accurate, they could cause radioactive or invasive damage to patients. Liquid biopsy as a noninvasive method is convenient for repeated sampling in clinical cancer prognostic, metastatic evaluation, and relapse monitoring. MicroRNAs encased in exosomes circulating in biofluids are promising candidate cancer biomarkers because of their cancer-specific expression profiles. Here, we report an in situ detection of microRNA-1246 (miR-1246) in human plasma exosomes as breast cancer biomarker by a nucleic acid functionalized Au nanoflare probe. Needing neither time-consuming and costly isolation of exosomes from the plasma sample nor transfection means, the Au nanoflare probe can directly enter the plasma exosomes to generate fluorescent signal quantitatively by specifically targeting miR-1246. Only 40 μL of plasma is needed to incubate 4 h with the probe, giving signal sensitive enough to distinguish samples of breast cancer to normal control. Using plasma miR-1246 level detected by our assay as a marker, we differentiated 46 breast cancer patients from 28 healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity at the best cutoff. This simple, accurate, sensitive, and cost-effective liquid biopsy by the Au nanoflare probe is potent to be developed as a noninvasive breast cancer diagnostic assay for clinical adaption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhai","given":"Ling-Yan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Min-Xiang"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Wei-Lun"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Min-Min"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Jian-Xin"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jin-Xiang"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Wen-Jun"}],"citation-key":"zhai2018","container-title":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","container-title-short":"ACS Appl.

  {"id":"zhang2005","abstract":"Rapid and highly sensitive detection of DNA is critical in diagnosing genetic diseases. Conventional approaches often rely on cumbersome, semi-quantitative amplification of target DNA to improve detection sensitivity. In addition, most DNA detection systems (microarrays, for example), regardless of their need for target amplification, require separation of unhybridized DNA strands from hybridized stands immobilized on a solid substrate, and are thereby complicated by solution–surface binding kinetics1,2. Here, we report an ultrasensitive nanosensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) capable of detecting low concentrations of DNA in a separation-free format. This system uses quantum dots (QDs)3,4,5 linked to DNA probes to capture DNA targets. The target strand binds to a dye-labelled reporter strand thus forming a FRET donor–acceptor ensemble. The QD also functions as a concentrator that amplifies the target signal by confining several targets in a nanoscale domain. Unbound nanosensors produce near-zero background fluorescence, but on binding to even a small amount of target DNA (∼50 copies or less) they generate a very distinct FRET signal. A nanosensor-based oligonucleotide ligation assay has been demonstrated to successfully detect a point mutation6 typical of some ovarian tumours in clinical samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chun-Yang"},{"family":"Yeh","given":"Hsin-Chih"},{"family":"Kuroki","given":"Marcos T."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Tza-Huei"}],"citation-key":"zhang2005","container-title":"Nature Materials","container-title-short":"Nature Mater","DOI":"10.1038/nmat1508","ISSN":"1476-4660","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",11]]},"language":"en","license":"2005 Nature Publishing Group","number":"11","page":"826-831","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Single-quantum-dot-based DNA nanosensor","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat1508","volume":"4"},

To provide the platform for DNA detection, the Ru-complex was first employed as an effective fluorescence quencher to TGA capped QDs via photoinduced electron transfer process. Because of its strong binding affinity with Ru(bpy)2(dppx)2+, complementary dsDNA can break up the low fluoresced ionic ensemble, set free the luminescent QDs, and concomitantly generate the Ru(bpy)2(dppx)2+ intercalated DNA complex. Thus, the recognition of dsDNA by Ru(bpy)2(dppx)2+ can be realized via both the restoration of QDs fluorescence and the emergence of a new fluorescence emission signal of the quencher−substrate at 609 nm, while single-stranded DNA, ribonucleic acid, bovine albumin serum, and biological relevant metal ions cannot produce the similar results.

  {"id":"zhou2014","abstract":"The bio-sensing for the convenient detection of bacteria has been widely explored with the use of various sensing materials and techniques. It is still a challenge to achieve an ultrasensitive and selective, but simple, rapid, and inexpensive detection method for bacteria. We report on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for the detection of living bacteria in drinking water by employing a synthesis of silver nanoparticles coating the cell wall of bacteria. We found that the Raman signals intensity of bacteria after AgNP synthesis mainly depends on the zeta potential of the cell wall. The enhancement of the Raman signal of bacteria using this strategy is about 30-fold higher than that in the case of a simply mixed colloid–bacterial suspension. The total assay time required is only 10 min and the total reactants’ volume needed to analyze bacteria in a real environment is as low as 1 mL. Particularly, only one droplet of 3 μL sample is necessary for each SERS measurement. Furthermore, we can use this novel strategy to discriminate three strains of Escherichia coli and one strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis by hierarchy cluster analysis. Finally, we can detect bacteria down to 2.5 × 102 cells/mL on a hydrophobic glass slide by SERS mapping. Thus, our detection method offers prominent advantages, such as reduced assay time, simple handling, low reactant volumes, small amount of sample, and higher sensitivity and selectivity compared to previously reported label free methods.

Consequently, COEs have excellent water solubility and the absence of nanoaggregates at concentrations up to 50 μM, and unbound COE dyes can be readily removed through ultrafiltration. These properties enable unambiguous and simple detection of COE-labeled small EVs using flow cytometry with negligible background signals.

  {"id":"zhu2012","abstract":"Prior to the evolution of complex biochemical machinery, the growth and division of simple primitive cells (protocells) must have been driven by environmental factors. We have previously demonstrated two pathways for fatty acid vesicle growth in which initially spherical vesicles grow into long filamentous vesicles; division is then mediated by fluid shear forces. Here we describe a different pathway for division that is independent of external mechanical forces. We show that the illumination of filamentous fatty acid vesicles containing either a fluorescent dye in the encapsulated aqueous phase, or hydroxypyrene in the membrane, rapidly induces pearling and subsequent division in the presence of thiols. The mechanism of this photochemically driven pathway most likely involves the generation of reactive oxygen species, which oxidize thiols to disulfide-containing compounds that associate with fatty acid membranes, inducing a change in surface tension and causing pearling and subsequent division. This vesicle division pathway provides an alternative route for the emergence of early self-replicating cell-like structures, particularly in thiol-rich surface environments where UV-absorbing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) could have facilitated protocell division. The subsequent evolution of cellular metabolic processes controlling the thiol:disulfide redox state would have enabled autonomous cellular control of the timing of cell division, a major step in the origin of cellular life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Ting F."},{"family":"Adamala","given":"Katarzyna"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Na"},{"family":"Szostak","given":"Jack W."}],"citation-key":"zhu2012","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1203212109","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"25","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,19]]},"language":"en","license":"©  .
