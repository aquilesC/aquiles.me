We identify 3 million mentor\textendash prot\'eg\'e pairs and survey a random sample, verifying that their relationship involved some form of mentorship. We find that mentorship quality predicts the scientific impact of the papers written by prot\'eg\'es post mentorship without their mentors. We also find that increasing the proportion of female mentors is associated not only with a reduction in post-mentorship impact of female prot\'eg\'es, but also a reduction in the gain of female mentors. While current diversity policies encourage same-gender mentorships to retain women in academia, our findings raise the possibility that opposite-gender mentorship may actually increase the impact of women who pursue a scientific career. These findings add a new perspective to the policy debate on how to best elevate the status of women in science.},

A realistic risk assessment must stand on representative data on the abundance, size distribution and chemical composition of microplastics. Raman microscopy is an indispensable tool for the analysis of very small microplastics ({$<$}20 mm). Still, its use is far from widespread, in part due to drawbacks such as long measurement time and proneness to spectral distortion induced by fluorescence. This review discusses each drawback followed by a showcase of interesting and easily available solutions that contribute to faster and better identification of microplastics using Raman spectroscopy. Among discussed topics are: enhanced signal quality with better detectors and spectrum processing; automated particle selection for faster Raman mapping; comprehensive reference libraries for successful spectral matching. A last section introduces non-conventional Raman techniques (non-linear Raman, hyperspectral imaging, standoff Raman) which permit more advanced applications such as real-time Raman detection and imaging of microplastics.},

Sample ion transport through nanochannels is largely a function of their interaction with electric double layer. For small ions, this coupling includes the net effect of the external applied field, the internal field of the double layer, and the non-uniform velocity of the liquid. Adsorption/desorption kinetics and the effects of surface roughness may also be important in nanochannel electrophoresis. For macromolecules, the resulting motion is more complex as there is further coupling via steric interactions and perhaps polarization effects. These complex interactions and coupled physics represent a valuable opportunity for novel electrophoretic and chromatographic separations. PMID: 17116262},

  abstract = {The response of a model micro-electrochemical system to a time-dependent applied voltage is analyzed. The article begins with a fresh historical review including electrochemistry, colloidal science, and microfluidics. The model problem consists of a symmetric binary electrolyte between parallel-plate, blocking electrodes which suddenly apply a voltage. Compact Stern layers on the electrodes are also taken into account. The Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations are first linearized and solved by Laplace transforms for small voltages, and numerical solutions are obtained for large voltages. The ``weakly nonlinear'' limit of thin double layers is then analyzed by matched asymptotic expansions in the small parameter \$\textbackslash epsilon = \textbackslash lambda\_D/L\$, where \$\textbackslash lambda\_D\$ is the screening length and \$L\$ the electrode separation. At leading order, the system initially behaves like an RC circuit with a response time of \$\textbackslash lambda\_D L / D\$ (not \$\textbackslash lambda\_D\^2/D\$), where \$D\$ is the ionic diffusivity, but nonlinearity violates this common picture and introduce multiple time scales. The charging process slows down, and neutral-salt adsorption by the diffuse part of the double layer couples to bulk diffusion at the time scale, \$L\^2/D\$. In the ``strongly nonlinear'' regime (controlled by a dimensionless parameter resembling the Dukhin number), this effect produces bulk concentration gradients, and, at very large voltages, transient space charge. The article concludes with an overview of more general situations involving surface conduction, multi-component electrolytes, and Faradaic processes.},

If a strong heterocoagulation happened, a single-modal electrophoretic mobility distribution with only one peak could be determined, and the peak located between the peaks of the two individual minerals. Without heterocoagulation, a bimodal electrophoretic mobility distribution with two peaks could be observed, which was consistent with the peaks of the two individual minerals.

The clash between the Spanish and Inca orders was experienced by the Incas as a disordering of the human and cosmic bodies.

Both micrometer-resolution particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) and particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) techniques have been used to quantify and study flow phenomena in electrokinetic systems applicable to microfluidic bioanalytical devices. To make the flow measurements quantitative, we performed a series of seed particle calibration experiments. First, we measure the electroosmotic wall mobility of a borosilicate rectangular capillary (40 by 400 {$\mu$}m) using current monitoring. In addition to this wall mobility characterization, we apply PTV to determine the electrophoretic mobilities of more than 1000 fluorescent microsphere particles in aqueous buffer solutions. Particles from this calibrated particle/buffer mixture are then introduced into two electrokinetic flow systems for particle tracking flow experiments. In these experiments, we use micro-PIV, together with an electric field prediction, to obtain electroosmotic flow bulk fluid velocity measurements. The first example flow system is a microchannel intersection where we demonstrate a detailed documentation of the similitude between the electrical fields and the velocity fields in an electrokinetic system with uniform zeta potential, {$\zeta$}. In the second system, we apply micro-PIV to a microchannel system with nonuniform {$\zeta$}. The latter experiment provides a simultaneous measurement of two distinct wall mobilities within the microchannel.},

  abstract = {Cellular microvesicles and nanovesicles (exosomes) are involved in many disease processes and have major potential as biomarkers. However, developments in this area are constrained by limitations in the technology available for their measurement. Here we report on the use of fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to rapidly size and phenotype cellular vesicles. In this system vesicles are visualized by light scattering using a light microscope. A video is taken, and the NTA software tracks the brownian motion of individual vesicles and calculates their size and total concentration. Using human placental vesicles and plasma, we have demonstrated that NTA can measure cellular vesicles as small as {$\sim$}50 nm and is far more sensitive than conventional flow cytometry (lower limit {$\sim$}300 nm). By combining NTA with fluorescence measurement we have demonstrated that vesicles can be labeled with specific antibody-conjugated quantum dots, allowing their phenotype to be determined.},

  abstract = {The release and uptake of nano-sized extracellular vesicles (EV) is a highly conserved means of intercellular communication. The molecular composition of EV, and thereby their signaling function to target cells, is regulated by cellular activation and differentiation stimuli. EV are regarded as snapshots of cells and are, therefore, in the limelight as biomarkers for disease. Although research on EV-associated RNA has predominantly focused on microRNAs, the transcriptome of EV consists of multiple classes of small non-coding RNAs with potential gene-regulatory functions. It is not known whether environmental cues imposed on cells induce specific changes in a broad range of EV-associated RNA classes. Here, we investigated whether immune-activating or -suppressing stimuli imposed on primary dendritic cells affected the release of various small noncoding RNAs via EV. The small RNA transcriptomes of highly pure EV populations free from ribonucleoprotein particles were analyzed by RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR. Immune stimulus-specific changes were found in the miRNA, snoRNA, and Y-RNA content of EV from dendritic cells, whereas tRNA and snRNA levels were much less affected. Only part of the changes in EV-RNA content reflected changes in cellular RNA, which urges caution in interpreting EV as snapshots of cells. By comprehensive analysis of RNA obtained from highly purified EV, we demonstrate that multiple RNA classes contribute to genetic messages conveyed via EV. The identification of multiple RNA classes that display cell stimulation-dependent association with EV is the prelude to unraveling the function and biomarker potential of these EV-RNAs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The surge of studies on artificial and natural nanoparticles has revealed a new world for engineering and life sciences, but in most instances, the small scale has made their number-concentration determination in liquids a challenging problem. Former success has mostly been limited to special particles measured by indirect techniques. A new approach is required for this determination to facilitate the production and application of nanoparticles in different systems. RESULT: Here, an approach is described using a nanoparticle tracking system based on Brownian motion, which can be used to determine the number-concentration of nanoparticles, including viruses, in liquids on-line. Extensive analysis showed the influence of suspension concentration and particle size on the accuracy of measurements. Natural nanoparticles of Adenovirus and several types of artificial nanoparticles, including precision nanobeads, uniform inorganic silica microspheres, monodisperse gold metal colloids and aggregated Aerosil nanoparticles, were measured and compared by counting the monitored particle number obtained using light scattered from individual particles, from which the particle number-concentration, the product yield and the aggregation could be evaluated. CONCLUSION: This approach was compared with the mathematical calculation method and the emission spectrophotometry technique used for practical applications. The results showed this new approach had improved accuracy for determination of the particle number-concentration.},

A main limiting factor for further development of fast video microscopy remains the illumination of the sample, which must deliver sufficient light to the camera to allow microsecond exposure times. Here we systematically compare the main illumination systems employed in holographic tracking microscopy, and we show that a superluminescent diode and a modulated laser diode perform the best in terms of image quality and acquisition speed, respectively. In particular, we show that the simple and inexpensive laser illumination enables less than 1ms camera exposure time at high magnification on a large field of view without coherence image artifacts, together with a good hologram quality that allows nm-tracking of microscopic beads to be performed. This comparison of sources can guide in choosing the most efficient illumination system with respect to the specific application.},

Evolving evidence is demonstrating that these EVs are playing an important role in health and disease. They are involved in intercellular communication and have been shown to transfer proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This review focuses on the most commonly used techniques for detection of EVs, to include microparticles, 100\textendash 1,000 nm in size, and exosomes, 50\textendash 100 nm in size. Conventional flow cytometry is the most prevalent technique, but nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and resistive pulse sensing have also been used to detect EVs. The accurate measurement of these vesicles is challenged by size heterogeneity, low refractive index, and the lack of dynamic measurement range for most of the available technologies. Sample handling during the preanalytical phase can also affect the accuracy of measurements. Currently, there is not one single method which allows phenotyping, sizing, and enumerating the whole range of EVs and, therefore, providing all the necessary information to truly understand the biology of these particles. A combination of methods is probably needed which might also include electron and atomic force microscopy and full RNA, lipid, and protein profiling. \textcopyright{} 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

It is also a major experimental challenge, particularly for small, nanometer-scale particles. Although methods such as confocal or fluorescence microscopy offer both high spatial resolution and high signal-to-background ratios, the fluorescence emission lifetime limits the measurement speed, while photobleaching and thermal diffusion limit the duration of measurements. Here we present a tracking method based on elastic light scattering that enables long-duration measurements of nanoparticle dynamics at rates of thousands of frames per second. We contain the particles within a single-mode silica fiber having a subwavelength, nanofluidic channel and illuminate them using the fiber's strongly confined optical mode. The diffusing particles in this cylindrical geometry are continuously illuminated inside the collection focal plane. We show that the method can track unlabeled dielectric particles as small as 20 nm as well as individual cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) virions;26 nm in size and 4.6 megadaltons in mass;at rates of over 3 kHz for durations of tens of seconds. Our setup is easily incorporated into common optical microscopes and extends their detection range to nanometer-scale particles and macromolecules. The ease-of-use and performance of this technique support its potential for widespread applications in medical diagnostics and micro total analysis systems.},

Based on a survey of Dutch practitioners on both sides of the transfer process, we test a number of hypotheses that differentiates between science-based regimes and development-based regimes. While our findings confirm our hypotheses concerning differences between the regimes regarding the use of specific transfer mechanisms, we also find that both regimes share a number of mechanisms that are similar. In addition, our findings show a remarkable degree of similarity among barriers inhibiting the process.

We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: e.g., novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity's role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.},

Here we demonstrate that exosomes from mouse and human lung-, liver- and brain-tropic tumour cells fuse preferentially with resident cells at their predicted destination, namely lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells, liver Kupffer cells and brain endothelial cells. We show that tumour-derived exosomes uptaken by organ-specific cells prepare the pre-metastatic niche. Treatment with exosomes from lung-tropic models redirected the metastasis of bone-tropic tumour cells. Exosome proteomics revealed distinct integrin expression patterns, in which the exosomal integrins {$\alpha$}6{$\beta$}4 and {$\alpha$}6{$\beta$}1 were associated with lung metastasis, while exosomal integrin {$\alpha$}v{$\beta$}5 was linked to liver metastasis. Targeting the integrins {$\alpha$}6{$\beta$}4 and {$\alpha$}v{$\beta$}5 decreased exosome uptake, as well as lung and liver metastasis, respectively. We demonstrate that exosome integrin uptake by resident cells activates Src phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory S100 gene expression. Finally, our clinical data indicate that exosomal integrins could be used to predict organ-specific metastasis.},

  abstract = {Huacas (shrines) and ushnus (ceremonial platforms) are ever-present elements of millennia-old Andean cosmology extending backward at least to Chav\'in de Huantar (1500-300 BCE). A major theme of Andean cosmology appears to be shamanic transcendence and transformation involving the three worlds of the cosmos. To avoid ethnocentrism, a new ontology may be necessary to grasp the full meaning of Andean astronomy. All of the known cases of astronomy in the archaeological record of the Inca appear to be associated with huaca sanctuaries that may also have been state- supported pilgrimage centers. The Sanctuary of Isla del Sol is a paradigmatic example of such a center. Its characteristic features are stonelined channels, sacred rock, gateways for controlling access to ritual space, physical separation of space according to social status, and areas designated for observing the solstice sun. Most of the sites considered in this paper are associated with the June solstice, contain huacas consisting of natural and carved rocks, show evidence of social differentiation of participants, and have channels for natural or offertory liquids.},

Here we demonstrate 3D tracking of diffusing 100 nm gold nanosphere within a water-filled optofluidic fiber via elastic light scattering\textendash based position retrieval. Specifically, the correlation between intensity and position inside a region of a fiber-integrated microchannel has been used to decode the axial position from the scattered intensity, while image processing\textendash based tracking was used in the image plane. The 3D trajectory of a diffusing gold nanosphere has been experimentally determined, while the determined diameter analysis matches expectations. Beside key advantages such as homogenous light-line illumination, low-background scattering, long observation time, large number of frames, high temporal and spatial resolution and compatibility with standard microscope, the particular properties of operating with water defines a new bioanalytical platform that is highly relevant for medical and life science applications.},

While beneficial aspects of nanomaterials are well visioned, several reports have suggested the negative impact of nanomaterials on living cells. The diverse array of surface properties achieved due to reduction in particle size that catalyzes the surface chemistry of nanoparticles is responsible for their toxic potential. Physical parameters such as surface area, particle size, surface charge, and zeta potential are very important for providing mechanistic details in the uptake, persistence, and biological toxicity of nanoparticles inside living cells. This short review provides insights into the physical, chemical, and interfacial parameters on the toxic potential of nanomaterials.

However, epistemology of experiments is not often addressed directly in the educational and pedagogical literature. This warrants an attempt to produce an acceptable reconstruction of the epistemological role of experiments in physics by drawing insight from history and philosophy of physics. Towards that end, the experiments' role in the 19th-century physics is discussed. We propose here a reconstruction, which is based on the idea that in epistemology of experiments the inductive-like generative justification of knowledge is central. A generative view makes it possible to retain those aspects of experiments which make them purposeful for learning and can give a starting point for students' own construction of knowledge. The reconstruction also helps to conceive the experiments with their correct historical role and helps to bring back the generative use of experiments in teaching, which, after all, has never vanished from the practice of physics.},

Quantitative measurement of the biophysical parameters of nanoparticle-protein interaction will improve such understanding, which could be conveniently performed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) as demonstrated in the present study. Two interaction situations were identified. Stable nanoparticle-protein complexes were resolved from the free nanoparticles and the proteins by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Transient complexes with fast association/dissociation rates showed distinct mobility change from the free nanoparticles in affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). Interactions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with the Fe3O4 nanoparticles (average diameters of 8 and 10 nm) and with the Au nanoparticles (average diameters of 5 and 10 nm) displayed slow and fast binding kinetics, respectively. Using the Hill equation, we could calculate the dissociation constants (KD) and cooperativity coefficients (n). Impacts on nanoparticle-protein interaction from the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the incubation buffer were evaluated on the basis of the KD and n values to interpret the interaction driving forces. Our study demonstrated the high simplicity and flexibility of CE in probing the interaction of proteins with diverse particles. The separation power of CE should also facilitate studies of the multicomponent interaction systems for investigating how adsorption onto nanoparticles could affect the protein-protein or protein-small molecule interactions.},

Indeed, sometimes it is simply misrepresented (Farrell 1976). When relating Hooke's law for bulk matter to the nature of interatomic forces, textbooks normally use the potential energy curve as a function of the atomic separation distance. In school physics textbooks, however, this curve is very superficially treated, and as a result students may fail to benefit from the curve. The author discusses some of the points concerning the curve which often prove to be a stumbling block to students trying to understand the curve.},

UV transparent integrated waveguides launch light at a wavelength of 254\,nm from a mercury lamp along the length of a 1-mm long detection cell. Transmitted UV light is collected by another waveguide in the opposite end of the detection cell, while visible fluorescence is collected vertically through the lid of the chip. The background of scattered excitation light is suppressed by detection perpendicular to the excitation, the limited UV transparency of the borosilicate lid and by choosing a PMT insensitive to the excitation light. This way, the need for a fluorescence filter is eliminated. Calibration curves were measured for serotonin, tryptophan, propranolol and acetaminophen, and separations of the four compounds were demonstrated by electrophoresis and MEKC. All compounds could be detected in the micromolar range by absorbance detection, but fluorescence detection improved detection limits for compounds displaying native UV fluorescence up to ten times. The simultaneous detection also proved useful for the identification of compounds with similar retention times and even enables accurate quantification of co-eluting compounds.},

This new method can be used to develop urinary extracellular vesicles further as a non-invasive tool for investigating human renal physiology. Abstract Exosomes are vesicles that are released from the kidney into urine. They contain protein and RNA from the glomerulus and all sections of the nephron and represent a reservoir for biomarker discovery. Current methods for the identification and quantification of urinary exosomes are time consuming and only semi-quantitative. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) counts and sizes particles by measuring their Brownian motion in solution. In this study, we applied NTA to human urine and identified particles with a range of sizes. Using antibodies against the exosomal proteins CD24 and aquaporin 2 (AQP2), conjugated to a fluorophore, we could identify a subpopulation of CD24- and AQP2-positive particles of characteristic exosomal size. Extensive pre-NTA processing of urine was not necessary. However, the intra-assay variability in the measurement of exosome concentration was significantly reduced when an ultracentrifugation step preceded NTA. Without any sample processing, NTA tracked exosomal AQP2 upregulation induced by desmopressin stimulation of kidney collecting duct cells. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was also able to track changes in exosomal AQP2 concentration that followed desmopressin treatment of mice and a patient with central diabetes insipidus. When urine was stored at room temperature, 4\textdegree C or frozen, nanoparticle concentration was reduced; freezing at -80\textdegree C with the addition of protease inhibitors produced the least reduction. In conclusion, with appropriate sample storage, NTA has potential as a tool for the characterization and quantification of extracellular vesicles in human urine.},

Feedback control algorithms are developed and demonstrated in realistic simulations to show 3D manipulation of one and two particles independently. The design and control results presented here are the essential next step to go from current 2D manipulation capabilities to an experimental demonstration of nano-precise 3D electrokinetic tweezing in a microfluidic system.

Particular emphasis was put on the model dependence of that interpretation and the need in most applications to forego the classical idealized model of spherical particles with ``smooth'' surfaces and to apply more realistic models, which take the ``hairy'' surface of real particles into account. Some highlights of the literature on the CZE of polystyrene latex microspheres, organic and inorganic colloids, lipoprotein particles, viruses, liposomes, biological membrane vesicles, and biological cells have been discussed. Also summarized are the reports on the particle size dependence of mobility and peak broadening in CZE and on electrophoretic behavior of rodlike particles and particle aggregates.

  abstract = {In this chapter we describe an interactive method of teaching, Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE), that helps students learn physics by engaging in processes that mirror the activities of physicists when they construct and apply knowledge. These processes involve observing, finding patterns, building and testing explanations of the patterns, and using multiple representations to reason about physical phenomena. ISLE is a comprehensive learning system that provides a general philosophy and specific activities that can be used in ``lectures'' (interactive meetings where students construct and test ideas), recitations (where students learn to represent them in multiple ways while solving problems) and labs (where students learn to design their own experiments to test hypotheses and solve practical problems). In ISLE, students are assessed for conceptual understanding, for problem-solving ability, and, most importantly, for their use of various scientific abilities. We have developed activities that help students acquire some of the abilities used by scientists in their work: experiment design, model building, use of multiple-representations, evaluation, etc. To determine the degree to which the students have acquired these abilities and to simultaneously provide feedback to the students, we have developed a set of rubrics that can be used by instructors for grading and by the students for self assessment. In this chapter we also provide a theoretical basis for the ISLE structure (using brain and cognitive research), explain how this learning system addresses the needs of the 21st century science education and workplace, and how it is different from other reformed curricula.},

This is a critical factor for correlating the nanoparticle surface characteristics with any measured biological/toxicological responses, as well as to provide an adequate reference point for comparing toxicity results with the hazard-based findings of other investigators. Moreover, when hazard or risk-based evaluations are made on a particular nanomaterial (based on a variety of studies), it is important to ensure that the nanoparticle-types are identical or very similar in composition. This can only be accomplished if rigorous characterization is conducted. In the absence of an adequate assessment of the physical characteristics, it is easy to draw general conclusions on nanoparticle-types which may have similar chemical compositions but, in fact, have different sizes, shapes, crystal structures, surface coatings, and surface reactivity characteristics. The determination of nanomaterial physicochemical properties is vitally important to nanomedicinal applications in that the fate, accumulation, and transport of nanomaterials through the body over time may be predicted based on specific surface characteristics.

Presented herein is a new technique to provide the non-uniform electric field required for DEP that does not require electrodes to contact the sample fluid. In our method, electrodes are capacitively-coupled to a fluidic channel through dielectric barriers; the application of a high-frequency electric field to these electrodes then induces an electric field in the channel. This technique combines the cell manipulation abilities of traditional DEP with the ease of fabrication found in insulator-based technologies. A microfluidic device was fabricated based on this principle to determine the feasibility of cell manipulations through contactless DEP (cDEP). We were able to demonstrate cell responses unique to the DEP effect in three separate cell lines. These results illustrate the potential for this technique to identify cells through their electrical properties without fear of contamination from electrodes.},

Many protein and DNA assays relevant to disease diagnosis are based on such separations. However, standard protocols are not only slow (minutes to hours) but also insensitive (many molecules in a detectable band). We successfully demonstrated a high-throughput imaging approach that allows determination of the individual electrophoretic mobilities of many molecules at a time. Each measurement only requires a few milliseconds to complete. This opens up the possibility of screening single copies of DNA or proteins within single biological cells for disease markers without performing polymerase chain reaction or other biological amplification. The purpose is not to separate the DNA molecules but to identify each one on the basis of the measured electrophoretic mobility. We developed three different procedures to measure the individual molecular mobilities. The results correlate well with capillary electrophoresis (CE) experiments for the same samples (2-49 kb dsDNA) under identical separation conditions. The implication is that any electrophoresis protocols from slab gels to CE should be adaptable to single-molecule screening for disease diagnosis.},

EV are 50\textendash 300 nm sized lipid membrane-enclosed particles produced by all cells that are broadly recognized for playing regulatory roles in numerous (patho)physiological processes, including viral infection. Both pro- and antiviral functions have been ascribed to EV released by virus-infected cells. It is currently not known whether this reported functional diversity is a result of the release of multiple virus-containing and non-virus containing EV subpopulations that differ in composition and function. Using encephalomyocarditis virus infection (EMCV, Picornaviridae family), we here provide evidence that EV populations released by infected cells are highly heterogeneous. Virus was contained in two distinct EV populations that differed in physical characteristics, such as sedimentation properties, and in enrichment for proteins indicative of different EV biogenesis pathways, such as the plasma membrane resident proteins Flotillin-1 and CD9, and the autophagy regulatory protein LC3. Additional levels of EV heterogeneity were identified using high-resolution flow cytometric analysis of single EV. Importantly, we demonstrate that EV subsets released during EMCV infection varied largely in potency of transferring virus infection and in their kinetics of release from infected cells. These data support the notion that heterogeneous EV populations released by virus-infected cells can exert diverse functions at distinct time points during infection. Unraveling the compositional, temporal and functional heterogeneity of these EV populations using single EV analysis technologies, as employed in this study, is vital to understanding the role of EV in virus dissemination and antiviral host responses.},

  abstract = {During development of adenovirus-based vaccines, samples have to be analyzed in order to either monitor the production process or control the quality and safety of the product. An important quality attribute is the total concentration of intact adenoviruses, which currently is determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or anion exchange-HPLC. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) was evaluated as alternative to the current methods with the aim to have one single method that allows reliable and fast quantification of adenovirus particles throughout the full process. Intact adenoviruses samples from downstream processing and upstream processing were analyzed directly by CE with UV-detection at 214 nm. Only the samples with high amounts of DNA required a simple sample pretreatment by benzonase. Adenovirus particles were separated from matrix components such as cell debris, residual cell DNA, and/or proteins on a PVA-coated capillary using a BGE consisting of 125 mM Tris, 338 mM tricine and 0.2\% v/v polysorbate-20 at pH 7.7. Full factorial design of experiments was used for method optimization as part of the analytical quality by design (AQbD) method development approach. The method was validated for the quantification of adenoviruses on five representative samples from the manufacturing process in the range of 0.5\texttimes 1011\textendash 1.5\texttimes 1011 adenovirus particles per ml (\textasciitilde 80 to 250 pmol/l). The CE method showed intermediate precision of 7.8\% RSD on concentration and an accuracy (spiked recovery) of 95\textendash 110\%. CE proved highly useful for process development support and is being implemented for in-process control testing for adenovirus vaccine manufacturing.},

Dutch universities are ranked high on research output but there is scarce evidence about the commercialization of research-based innovation. We present a novel approach to measure the performance of university technology transfer using meta data analysis. We use data on research output as meta-data to estimates the potential for technology transfer, and data about the actual technology transfer projects as measured by patents, license agreements and spin-offs. We tested our model for Dutch universities and validated it using data from private and state universities in the US. Our results suggest that most Dutch research universities have poor performance while technical Dutch universities and academic medical center perform well. We pilot-tested our model for selected US universities and the result confirm the validity of our approach. Our approach contributes to the literature on university technology transfer by adding a novel approach for measuring performance of university technology transfer while taking into account university research as the potential for technology transfer.},

Here, we present a method for the tracking of features that partially overlap, in order to be able to track so-called colloidal molecules. Our approach implements two improvements into existing particle tracking algorithms. Firstly, we use the history of previously identified feature locations to successfully find their positions in consecutive frames. Secondly, we present a framework for non-linear least-squares fitting to summed radial model functions and analyze the accuracy (bias) and precision (random error) of the method on artificial data. We find that our tracking algorithm correctly identifies overlapping features with an accuracy below 0.2\% of the feature radius and a precision of 0.1 to 0.01 pixels for a typical image of a colloidal cluster. Finally, we use our method to extract the three-dimensional diffusion tensor from the Brownian motion of colloidal dimers.},

  abstract = {We electrokinetically characterize properties of single 42-nm polystyrene nanoparticles (NP) in nanofluidic channels imaged with frustrated total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (fTIRFM). Specifically, we demonstrate fTIRFM of individual NPs in nanofluidic channels shallower than the evanescent field and use the resultant illumination field to gain insight into the behavior and electrokinetic properties of individual NP transport in channels. We find that the electrophoretic mobility of nanoparticles in 100-nm channels is lower than in larger channels or in bulk, presumably due to hindrance effects. Furthermore, we notice a non-intuitive increase in mobility with buffer concentration, which we attribute to electric double layer interactions. Finally, since the evanescent field intensity decreases with distance from the channel wall, we use the measured fluorescence intensity to report probable transverse distributions of free-solution 42-nm polystyrene fluorescent particles. Our method promises to be useful for characterizing nanoscale molecules for many applications in drug discovery, bioanalytics, nanoparticle synthesis, viral targeting, and the basic science of understanding nanoparticle behavior.},

  abstract = {The abundance of plastic products in modern society has resulted in a proliferation of small plastic particles called ``microplastics'' in the global environment. Currently, spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared and spontaneous (i.e., conventional) Raman spectroscopy are widely employed for the identification of the plastic microparticles, but these are rather time consuming. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, based on the coherent interaction of 2 different laser beams with vibrational levels in the molecules of the sample, would enable much faster detection and identification of microplastics. Here, we present for the first time an SRS-based method for identifying 5 different high production-volume polymer types in microplastics extracted from environmental or consumer product samples. The particles from the extracts were collected on a flat alumina filter, and 6 SRS images were acquired at specifically chosen wavenumbers. Next, we decomposed these spectral data into specific images for the 5 polymers selected for calibration. We tested the approach on an artificial mixture of plastic particles and determined the signal-to-noise and level of cross talk for the 5 polymer types. As a proof of principle, we identified polyethylene terephthalate particles extracted from a commercial personal care product, demonstrating also the thousand-fold higher speed of mapping with SRS compared with conventional Raman. Furthermore, after density separation of a Rhine estuary sediment sample, we scanned 1 cm2 of the filter surface in less than 5 hr and detected and identified 88 microplastics, which corresponds to 12,000 particles per kilogram dry weight. We conclude that SRS can be an efficient method for monitoring microplastics in the environment and potentially many other matrices of interest.},
